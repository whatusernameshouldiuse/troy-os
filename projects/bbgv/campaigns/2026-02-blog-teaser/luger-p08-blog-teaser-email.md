**Email Body:**

1945. Germany surrenders. American soldiers sweep through what remains of the Reich, and they all want the same souvenir.

A Luger.

Officers traded cartons of cigarettes for them. Enlisted men risked court-martial to smuggle them home. An estimated 50,000 to 100,000 Lugers came back with American troops.

The problem? Many were fakes even then.

**We just published a deep dive on the Luger P08** — the pistol that invented the 9mm cartridge, served through two World Wars, and became the most counterfeited collector firearm in America.

Here's what you'll learn:

- **The toggle-lock action** — why a pistol designed in 1900 is still a mechanical marvel
- **5 types of Luger fraud** — force-matched numbers, fake proof marks, and the "SS marked" Luger that never existed
- **Current market values** — from $1,200 mismatched shooters to $25,000+ Navy models
- **Authentication steps** — what to check before buying or selling

If you inherited a Luger or own one, this is worth 10 minutes of your time.

Worth noting: The Luger market rewards knowledge. The difference between "my grandfather's war trophy" and "authenticated all-matching 1940 Mauser with capture papers" can be $5,000+.

Know what you have.
