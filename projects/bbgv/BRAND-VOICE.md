## Brand Personality: The Four Corners

BBGV's voice is a unique blend of four distinct personalities. Adjust the mix based on content type (see Tone Matrix below).

- Not afraid to have an opinion ("Here's what I'd do...")
- Uses casual phrases but never sounds unprofessional

**When to dial up:** Social media, newsletter intros, blog posts for inheritors

### 2. Trusted Authority (40%)
**Character:** The expert witness in a courtroom - unimpeachable, data-backed

- Definitive statements backed by 45+ years of data
- Precise terminology (we don't say "old gun," we say "Pre-64 Winchester")
- References price history, market trends, production runs
- Never hedges when we know the answer
- Commands respect through knowledge, not arrogance

**When to dial up:** Landing pages, pricing pages, FFL/professional content, authentication services

- Timely, in-the-know, plugged in
- Shares market intel others don't have
- "Here's what we're seeing..." observations
- Trend-spotting and forward-looking
- Creates FOMO through exclusivity of information

**When to dial up:** Newsletter market updates, blog posts about trends, email campaigns

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Newsletter Opening

**BEFORE (Generic):**
> Welcome to this week's newsletter! We have some great content for you today about the firearms market. Let's dive in!

**AFTER (BBGV Voice):**
> Three Pre-64 Model 70s sold for 40% over book value last week. Here's why - and what it means for your collection.

**Why it works:** Market Insider + Expert Friend blend. Creates immediate value, no fluff.

---

### Example 2: Inheritor Landing Page

**BEFORE (Pushy):**
> Don't get ripped off! Get your FREE gun valuation NOW before it's too late!

**AFTER (BBGV Voice):**

---

### Example 3: Blog Post (Collector Audience)

**BEFORE (Dry):**
> The Colt Python was manufactured from 1955 to 2005. Production numbers varied by year.

**AFTER (BBGV Voice):**
> Colt made 850,000 Pythons between 1955 and 2005 - but Pre-1970 examples with original grips? That's a different story. Here's what production records tell us about pricing tiers.

**Why it works:** Trusted Authority + Market Insider. Specific data, insider knowledge, sets up value.

---

### Example 4: Social Media Post

**BEFORE (Bro-y):**
> INSANE auction results this week! 🔥🔥🔥 You won't BELIEVE what this sold for!

**AFTER (BBGV Voice):**
> 1942 Winchester M1 Carbine just sold for $3,200 at Rock Island. That's 2.1x our book value. Context: pristine GI condition, documented provenance. The market's rewarding paperwork right now.

**AFTER:**
- "Pre-64 Winchesters up 18% this quarter"

**Why it works:** Clear value proposition, no manipulation, curiosity through specificity.

---

> Hey there! Want to make more money on your trades? We've got you covered!

**AFTER (BBGV Voice):**
> FFL wholesale pricing updated daily. Track cost basis, margin analysis, and inventory valuation in real-time. Built for dealers who know their numbers.

**Why it works:** Trusted Authority dominant. Speaks dealer language, respects their expertise.

## Writing Checklist

Before publishing any BBGV content, verify:

- [ ] **Authority check:** Is there data/evidence backing claims? (or could there be?)
- [ ] **Fluff patrol:** Cut the first sentence. Does it still work? (If yes, cut it.)
- [ ] **Buzzword scan:** Remove any words from the BANNED list
- [ ] **Tone check:** Does this match the content type in the Tone Matrix?
- [ ] **Specificity test:** Replace vague words with precise ones (numbers, years, models)
- [ ] **Helpfulness filter:** Would an inheritor AND a collector find this useful?
- [ ] **Action clarity:** Is it obvious what the reader should do next?

## Handling Common Scenarios

### When We Don't Know Something
**DON'T:** Guess or hedge excessively
**DO:** "We don't have enough data on that model to give you a confident number. Here's what we'd need to see..." or "That's outside our typical coverage area - worth consulting a [specialist type]."

### When Delivering Bad News (Low Value)
**DON'T:** Sugarcoat or oversell
**DO:** "Real talk: this model typically runs $200-350 in current market conditions. Here's why - and what affects value on these."

### When Delivering Good News (High Value)
**DON'T:** Create false excitement
**DO:** "Based on recent auction results and condition factors, you're likely looking at $2,500-3,200. Worth noting: [specific factors affecting price]."

### When Someone Disagrees with Our Valuation
**DON'T:** Get defensive
**DO:** "Our valuations reflect broad market trends across thousands of transactions. Individual sales vary based on [factors]. Happy to walk through how we arrived at this number."

### When Explaining Complex Topics
**DON'T:** Dumb it down condescendingly
**DO:** "This gets technical, but it matters. [Complex topic] means [simple explanation]. Here's why that affects value..."

### THE BBGV VOICE FILTER

**Before publishing, ask:**

1. **Is it specific?** (Names, numbers, years > vague adjectives)
2. **Is it helpful?** (Teaches or informs > sells or hypes)
3. **Is it credible?** (Data-backed > opinion-only)
4. **Is it clear?** (Simple language > jargon)
5. **Is it confident?** (Definitive when we know > hedging)

### PERSONALITY MIX CHEAT SHEET

- **Need warmth?** Add "here's what we'd do" or real examples
- **Need education?** Add "here's why that matters" explanations

### RED FLAGS (Fix immediately)

- Exclamation points in every sentence

## Examples from the Wild

### Newsletter Excellence: Market Update
> Colt Python prices are up 23% year-over-year, but here's the nuance: Pre-1970 examples with original grips are driving the spike. Later production (1970-2005) is holding steady at $1,500-2,200. Why? Collectors are willing to pay premiums for early serial ranges and documented provenance. If you're sitting on a 1960s Python, now's your moment.

**Analysis:** Perfect blend - Market Insider data, Expert Friend conversational flow, Trusted Authority specifics.

---

### Landing Page Excellence: Inheritor Journey
> You inherited a gun collection. Now what?
>
> Most people in your situation have three questions:
> 1. What do I have?
> 2. What's it worth?
> 3. What are my options?
>
> We've answered these questions for 180,000+ firearms over 45 years. Here's how we help...

**Analysis:** Educator empathy, Trusted Authority credibility, clear structure.

---

### Social Media Excellence: Quick Take
> 1903 Springfield just sold for $1,850 at auction. That's $200 over our book value. Condition was excellent, but here's what pushed it higher: original 1918-dated barrel, documented service record. The market pays for stories.

**Analysis:** Data-first, insight-driven, teaches while informing. Expert Friend + Market Insider.

---

- **v1.0 (2026-01-28):** Initial brand voice guide created. Based on four personality framework (Expert Friend, Trusted Authority, Educator, Market Insider). Includes tone matrix, 6 before/after examples, content templates, and quick reference card.
