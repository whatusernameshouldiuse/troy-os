# Product Marketing Context — BBGV

*Last updated: 2026-02-23*

## Product Overview
**One-liner:** The definitive firearms valuation authority — 45 years of data behind every number.
**What it does:** Blue Book of Gun Values provides accurate market valuations for 180K+ firearms, helping gun owners, buyers, sellers, collectors, and FFLs know exactly what any gun is worth. Transitioning to freemium with InstaCash Offers (direct buy from sellers) and consignment as primary revenue.
**Product category:** Firearms valuation / gun pricing authority (how customers search: "what is my gun worth", "blue book value gun", "gun price guide")
**Product type:** SaaS + marketplace + data authority
**Business model:** Free (basic lookup) → Power User $10/mo → FFL $30/mo + InstaCash Offers (buy guns from sellers) + Consignment + Niche books

## Target Audience
**Primary users:** Gun owners looking to buy or sell used firearms
**Decision-makers:** Individual gun owners, FFL dealers, insurance appraisers, estate attorneys
**Primary use case:** "What is this gun actually worth right now?" — before buying, selling, insuring, or inheriting
**Jobs to be done:**
- "Help me not get ripped off buying this used gun"
- "Tell me what I should list this for when I sell"
- "Give me a defensible number for insurance/estate purposes"
- "Help me run my FFL more profitably with accurate inventory pricing"

**ICPs:**
- **Inheritors:** "I inherited grandpa's guns, what are they worth?" — emotional, time-sensitive, zero baseline knowledge
- **Collectors:** Serious valuation needs, collection tracking, authentication — data-hungry, high LTV
- **FFLs:** Wholesale pricing, inventory valuation, professional tool — $30/mo tier
- **Used gun buyers:** "Is $550 a fair price for this Glock 19?" — transactional, high search volume
- **Sellers:** "What should I list this for?" — millions of Armslist/GunBroker listings

## Problems & Pain Points
**Core problem:** Gun owners have no trustworthy, current, data-backed source for what their specific gun is actually worth. Dealers lowball. YouTube videos are stale. Forums give opinions, not data.
**Why alternatives fall short:**
- Gun shop trade-ins: lowball offers, pressure to take store credit, opaque pricing
- GunBroker/Armslist comps: labor-intensive, inconsistent condition grading
- Generic web searches: outdated, not condition-adjusted
- Other price guides: less data, less history, less credibility
**What it costs them:** Getting $280 for a gun worth $650. Overpaying $200 for a used pistol. Underinsuring a $15K collection.
**Emotional tension:** "Am I being taken advantage of? Do they think I don't know what I have?"

## Competitive Landscape
**Direct:** GunBroker sold listings (free but requires manual research), Gun Digest (print, stale)
**Secondary:** Local gun shops (human expert but biased), online forums (opinion-based)
**Indirect:** Just guessing / accepting dealer offer (inertia — most common "competitor")
**How each falls short:** None provide instant, condition-adjusted, current-market values backed by 45 years of transaction data.

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- 45 years of transaction history — no one else has this data depth
- 180K+ valuations — broadest coverage in the industry
- Condition-adjusted pricing (Excellent/Very Good/Good/Fair/Poor)
- Price history trends — not just today's value but trajectory
- Authentication/grading service — physical inspection capability
- BBGV IS the citation — referenced by courts, insurance companies, estate attorneys
**Why customers choose us:** "It's the Blue Book. It's what everyone else references. If BBGV says $650, that's the number."

## Objections
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I can find this on GunBroker for free" | GunBroker shows asking prices, not what guns actually SELL for. BBGV shows real transaction values, condition-adjusted, from 45 years of data. |
| "I only need one valuation, why subscribe?" | Free tier gets you in the database. InstaCash gives you an offer based on the actual number. |
| "My gun shop told me it was worth X" | Gun shops buy to resell at a profit. Their offer is their margin, not your gun's value. |

**Anti-persona:** Casual gun owner who doesn't buy/sell/inherit frequently and has no professional need — the free tier handles them.

## Switching Dynamics
**Push:** Getting consistently lowballed at trade-ins; can't trust the number they're given
**Pull:** Authoritative, data-backed number they can quote with confidence; InstaCash offer based on real data
**Habit:** "I just accept whatever the dealer says" — decades of information asymmetry normalized
**Anxiety:** "What if even BBGV is wrong about my specific gun?" — addressed by specificity and history depth

## Customer Language
**How they describe the problem:**
- "I have no idea what this is worth"
- "The dealer offered me $300 but that seemed low"
- "I need a number I can actually defend"
- "What's the blue book on this?"
**How they describe BBGV:**
- "It's the Kelley Blue Book for guns"
- "The most trusted source for gun values"
- "If BBGV says it, that's the number"
**Words to use:** value, worth, market price, current, data, 45 years, trusted, condition-adjusted
**Words to avoid:** appraisal (implies formal legal opinion), guarantee, exact price

## Brand Voice
