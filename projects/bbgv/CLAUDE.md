# BBGV — Project Operating Instructions

## Before Any Marketing Task

1. **Read context first:** Load `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — this has ICPs, brand voice, competitive landscape, customer language, objections, and proof points. Do not ask for information already covered there.

2. **Pick the right skill:** Check `~/clawd/skills/` for the applicable skill. Use it.
   - Writing copy → `copywriting` or `copywriter`
   - Email sequences → `email-sequence`
   - CRO / page optimization → `page-cro`
   - SEO → `seo-audit` or `programmatic-seo`
   - Content ideas → `content-strategy` or `marketing-ideas`
   - Social content → `social-content`
   - Lead magnets / free tools → `free-tool-strategy`
   - Referral / affiliate → `referral-program`
   - Ads → `ad-creative` or `paid-ads`
   - Launch → `launch-strategy`

3. **Execute to draft-ready status.** Don't stop at outlines. Write the actual copy, full email, complete landing page. Troy reviews, not rewrites.

4. **Output to Obsidian:** Write directly to `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/BBGV/` and open immediately:
   `open "obsidian://open?vault=Work&file=Projects%2FBBGV%2F<filename>"`

## Project Context

- **Website:** bluebookofgunvalues.com
- **Revenue focus (2026):** InstaCash Offers (buy guns from sellers) + Consignment + FFL subscriptions
- **Email list:** 180K on Klaviyo
- **Freemium transition:** Valuations becoming free; ICO is the primary conversion
- **Lead magnet:** "What's This Gun Worth?" two-sided tool (buyers + sellers) — in build
- **Marketing model:** Thought Leader (data-driven authority, long-form, unique 45-year dataset)
- **Obsidian path:** `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/BBGV/`

## Brand Rules

- Voice: Expert Friend (30%) + Trusted Authority (40%) + Educator (20%) + Market Insider (10%)
- NEVER position ICO as "we pay more than dealers" — we don't always. Positioning is convenience + fairness + no pressure.
- NEVER give away valuations as a lead magnet — that's the product
- USE specific model names (Pre-64 Winchester, Colt Python) not generic "old gun"
- NO: hype, false urgency, political statements, gun bro culture
