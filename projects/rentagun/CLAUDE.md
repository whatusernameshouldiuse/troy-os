# Rentagun — Project Operating Instructions

## Before Any Marketing Task

1. **Read context first:** Load `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — this has ICPs, brand voice, competitive landscape, customer language, objections, and proof points. Do not ask for information already covered there.

2. **Pick the right skill:** Check `~/clawd/skills/` for the applicable skill. Use it.
   - Writing copy → `copywriting` or `copywriter`
   - Email sequences → `email-sequence`
   - CRO / page optimization → `page-cro`
   - Affiliate/referral program → `referral-program`
   - Content ideas → `content-strategy` or `marketing-ideas`
   - Social content → `social-content`
   - Signup flow → `signup-flow-cro`
   - Ads → `ad-creative` or `paid-ads`
   - Launch → `launch-strategy`

3. **Execute to draft-ready status.** Don't stop at outlines. Write the actual copy, full email, complete landing page. Troy reviews, not rewrites.

4. **Output to Obsidian:** Write directly to `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/Rentagun/` and open immediately:
   `open "obsidian://open?vault=Work&file=Projects%2FRentagun%2F<filename>"`

- Voice: Straight-shooter, no BS, fun. "Your buddy who's been to every range."
- Core message: Try before you buy. Stop researching, start shooting.
- NEVER say "Netflix of guns"
- NO political statements, NO safety violations in content
- Keep it real — authentic outdoor lifestyle, not stock photos
- Geographic exclusion: CA + 12 other restrictive states — never promise availability without noting this
