# Rentagun Social Posts — Mar 9-13, 2026

**Theme:** Turkey Season Prep (Week 2)
**Concept:** Turkey season is around the corner in most states (April-May). Hunters need to know their shotgun before they're sitting in a blind at 4am. This week shifts from general spring energy to specific hunting prep — shotguns, patterning, and the semi-auto vs pump debate. Position Rentagun as the smart move before a hunt, not an impulse buy at the counter.

**Weekly Structure:**
- Monday: Educational/Problem-Solving
- Tuesday: Inventory Spotlight
- Wednesday: Customer Story / UGC
- Thursday: Quick Tips / Hacks
- Friday: Weekend Inspiration

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
Turkey Gun Showdown
Semi-Auto vs Pump vs Over/Under

**Slide 2:**
The Semi-Auto (Benelli M2, Beretta A300)
Pros: Fast follow-up shots. Reduced felt recoil. Modern reliability.
Cons: More moving parts. Higher price ($1,200-$1,800). Needs cleaning.
Best for: Hunters who want every advantage and don't mind paying for it.

**Slide 3:**
The Pump (Mossberg 500, Remington 870)
Pros: Bombproof reliable. $300-$600 price range. Eats any ammo.
Cons: Slower follow-up. More felt recoil. Manual cycling under pressure.
Best for: Budget-conscious hunters and anyone who values simplicity.

**Slide 4:**
The Over/Under (Browning Citori, Beretta 686)
Pros: Two choke options in one gun. Clean break-open action. Classic look.
Cons: Only 2 shots. Heavy. Expensive ($1,500-$3,000+).
Best for: Traditionalists and upland crossover hunters.

**Slide 5:**
The Real Question
Which one patterns best with YOUR turkey load, at YOUR shooting distance, with YOUR cheek weld?

That's not a spec sheet answer. That's a range answer.

**Slide 6:**
The Smart Move
Rent all three. Different weeks. Same turkey load. Same choke. Same 40-yard target.

Compare YOUR patterns. Not someone else's YouTube patterns.

**Slide 7 (CTA):**
Turkey season starts in weeks.
Rent the shotgun. Pattern it. Trust it.
Don't walk into the blind with a gun you've never patterned.

**Caption:**
Turkey season is coming. The eternal debate is heating up:

Semi-auto vs pump vs over/under.

Everyone's got an opinion. The guy at the gun counter. Your hunting buddy. Every forum on the internet.

Here's the thing: turkey loads pattern differently through every gun. YOUR cheek weld. YOUR preferred load. YOUR distance.

The only way to settle it? Rent the top 3. Same ammo, same choke, same 40-yard target. Compare YOUR data.

Swipe through for the breakdown.

## Tuesday, Mar 10 — Inventory Spotlight

**Type:** Instagram Carousel (4 slides) + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Featured Gun:** Benelli M2 Field (semi-auto shotgun)
**Why this gun:** Premium turkey gun. The Benelli vs Beretta debate is one of the biggest in turkey hunting. Inertia-driven system is unique. High price point ($1,400-$1,800) makes renting before buying the obvious play.

### Instagram

**Slide 1:**
Benelli M2 Field
The turkey gun everyone argues about. Time to settle it yourself.

**Slide 2:**
Specs:
- Gauge: 12 GA
- Chamber: 3"
- Barrel: 24" or 26"
- Weight: 6.9 lbs
- Action: Inertia-driven semi-auto
- MSRP: ~$1,499

**Slide 3:**
Best For:
- Turkey hunters debating Benelli vs Beretta A400
- Anyone curious about inertia-driven vs gas-operated
- Waterfowl crossover (it handles both seasons)
- Shooters ready to invest $1,500 but smart enough to test first

**Slide 4 (CTA):**
Rent the Benelli M2 for 7 days.
Pattern it with your turkey load.
If you buy, your rental fee applies.

**Caption:**
The Benelli M2.

If you've spent any time in turkey hunting forums, you've seen the debate: Benelli M2 vs Beretta A400. Inertia-driven vs gas-operated. It's been going for a decade and nobody's winning.

Here's what they don't argue about: both are expensive. The M2 runs $1,400-$1,800 depending on configuration.

That's a lot of money to spend on "the internet said so."

The M2's inertia system is different from anything else you've shot. Lighter, cleaner, faster cycling — but it also kicks differently. Some hunters love it. Some don't.

$1,500 is too much to gamble on "I think I'll like it."

Rent it. Pattern it with your turkey loads. Shoot 50 rounds. Feel the inertia system yourself.

If you love it, keep it — your rental fee applies to purchase.

If you don't, you just saved $1,500 and a season of regret.

## Wednesday, Mar 11 — Customer Story / UGC

**Type:** Instagram Feed Post + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Format:** Testimonial-style post about borrowing vs renting the right gun

### Instagram

**Caption:**
"Last spring was my first turkey hunt. Borrowed my buddy's Remington 870 Express.

Day 1: Sitting in the blind at 5am. Tom comes in at 35 yards. Perfect setup.

I pull the trigger. The pattern was all over the place. Bird flinched and walked away.

Turns out my buddy shoots modified choke for everything. I needed an extra-full turkey choke. And the gun didn't fit me — I'm 6'2" and his LOP was set for his 5'9" frame. My cheek weld was garbage.

I spent 4 months getting that tag. Blew it because I was shooting someone else's setup.

This year I rented a Benelli M2 through Rentagun. Spent a Saturday patterning it with Hevi-Shot Magnum Blend at 40 yards. Dialed in the choke. Adjusted the stock. Knew exactly where that pattern was going.

Opening morning, tom at 38 yards. One shot. Done.

The rental cost me $125. The tag cost me $30. The look on my buddy's face when I showed him the bird? Priceless."
— Daniel K., Wisconsin

That's the difference between borrowing someone else's setup and showing up prepared.

Turkey hunting isn't forgiving. You get one shot. Maybe two. The gun needs to be dialed for YOU — your load, your choke, your cheek weld, your distance.

$125 to know your pattern cold vs hoping your buddy's gun works.

## Thursday, Mar 12 — Quick Tips

**Type:** Instagram Carousel (7 slides) + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Topic:** "3 Things to Test Before Turkey Season (That You Can Only Test by Shooting)"

### Instagram

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
3 Things to Test Before Turkey Season
(That You Can Only Test by Shooting)

**Slide 2:**
#1 — Pattern Density at 40 Yards
Your turkey load + your choke + your barrel = a pattern that's unique to YOUR setup. Two identical guns can pattern differently. The ONLY way to know is to shoot paper at 40 yards. Count the pellets in a 10" circle. If it's under 100, change something.

**Slide 3:**
Why it matters:
A turkey's kill zone is roughly the size of a baseball. At 40 yards, you need a tight, dense pattern with zero gaps. A thin spot in your pattern at 40 yards = a crippled bird and a lost hunt. You can't see this on a spec sheet.

**Slide 4:**
#2 — Trigger Feel Under Pressure
The trigger on a turkey gun matters more than you think. You're sitting still for hours. Hands get cold. Adrenaline is pumping. You need a clean, predictable break — not a gritty pull that makes you flinch. Dry-fire practice at home helps. Live fire tells the truth.

**Slide 5:**
Why it matters:
You'll likely get ONE trigger pull on a turkey. A heavy, creepy trigger causes flinch. Flinch moves your pattern 6-12 inches at 40 yards. That's the difference between a clean kill and a miss. Test the trigger with live rounds before you trust it in the field.

**Slide 6:**
#3 — Cheek Weld with YOUR Face
Every stock fits differently. Your cheekbone, your neck length, your shooting eye. If the stock doesn't fit, your eye isn't centered on the bead — and your pattern goes where you're NOT looking. Borrow a gun? You're shooting someone else's fit. Rent one and spend 30 minutes getting YOUR cheek weld right.

**Slide 7 (CTA):**
Turkey season doesn't give second chances.
Rent the shotgun. Test the pattern. Test the trigger. Test the fit.
Walk into the blind prepared — not hopeful.
Link in bio.

**Caption:**
Here's what you can't test at a gun counter:

1. Pattern density — your load + your choke + your barrel = a unique pattern. Shoot paper at 40 yards. Count the pellets.
2. Trigger feel — you get ONE pull on a turkey. A gritty trigger causes flinch. Flinch moves your pattern 6-12 inches.
3. Cheek weld — every stock fits differently. If the stock doesn't fit YOUR face, your eye isn't on the bead.

All three require live ammo and range time. Not YouTube. Not a gun counter. Not your buddy's opinion.

Turkey season gives you one shot. Maybe two. Make sure the gun is dialed for you.

Save this for pre-season prep.

3 Things to Test Before Turkey Season (That You Can Only Test by Shooting)

1. Pattern Density at 40 Yards
Your turkey load + your choke + your barrel = a pattern unique to YOUR gun. Shoot paper at 40 yards. Count pellets in a 10" circle. Under 100? Change something. A turkey's kill zone is the size of a baseball.

2. Trigger Feel Under Pressure
One trigger pull. Cold hands. Adrenaline pumping. A gritty trigger causes flinch. Flinch moves your pattern 6-12 inches at 40 yards. That's the difference between a clean kill and a miss.

3. Cheek Weld with YOUR Face
Every stock fits differently. If the stock doesn't fit your face, your eye isn't on the bead — and your pattern goes where you're NOT looking.

All three require live ammo and range time. Not YouTube. Not a gun counter.

Turkey season gives you one shot. Make sure the gun is dialed for you.

3 things you can't test at a gun counter:

1. Pattern density at 40 yards (shoot paper, count pellets)
2. Trigger feel under adrenaline (gritty trigger = flinch = missed bird)
3. Cheek weld with YOUR face (wrong fit = pattern goes sideways)

Turkey season gives you one shot. Be ready.

## Friday, Mar 13 — Weekend Inspiration

**Topic:** "Spring Scouting Weekend — Bring the Right Shotgun"

### Instagram

**Caption:**
This weekend, go scout.

Not just the land. The gun.

If turkey season opens in your state in 3-4 weeks, the clock is ticking. You need to know two things before opening day:

1. Where the birds are
2. What your pattern looks like at 40 yards

Most hunters handle #1 and skip #2. Then they wonder why they missed a bird that was right there.

Here's the weekend mission:

Saturday morning: Scout your spot. Glass the fields. Listen for gobbles.
Saturday afternoon: Take your shotgun to the range. Shoot 3-5 patterns at 40 yards with your turkey load. Mark the best one.

Don't have a turkey gun yet? That's what the rental is for.

Rent the Benelli M2, the Mossberg 500, or whatever's on your shortlist. Spend this weekend testing it. You've got 3-4 weeks to figure out your setup.

Don't wait until the night before opening day to wonder if your gun patterns right.

Rent it this weekend. Pattern it. Walk into the blind prepared.

Spring Scouting Weekend — Don't Forget the Gun

Most turkey hunters spend weekends scouting land. Listening for gobbles. Glassing fields.

Good.

But how many pattern their shotgun at 40 yards before opening day?

If turkey season opens in 3-4 weeks, here's your weekend:

Saturday AM: Scout your spot. Find the birds.
Saturday PM: Take your shotgun to the range. Shoot 3-5 patterns at 40 yards.

Don't have a turkey gun yet? Rent one. Benelli M2, Mossberg 500, Remington 870 — whatever's on your list.

You've got 3-4 weekends left. Don't waste them.
