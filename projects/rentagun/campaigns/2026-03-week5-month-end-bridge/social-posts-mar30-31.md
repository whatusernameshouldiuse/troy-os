# Rentagun Social Posts — Mar 30-31, 2026

**Theme:** Month-End Bridge (Week 5)
**Concept:** Close out March. Recap the spring range season — lever actions, hunting prep, carry transitions. Tee up April's theme: Tax Refund Season. A lot of gun purchases happen in April-May when refund checks land. Rentagun's angle: before you spend your refund on a gun you've never shot, rent it first. Two posts to bridge March into April.

**Weekly Structure (abbreviated — only Monday + Tuesday):**
- Monday: March Recap
- Tuesday: April Preview / Tax Refund Tease

## Monday, Mar 30 — March Recap

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
March 2026 Rental Recap
What You Tried. What You Learned.

**Slide 2:**
Week 1-2: Hunting Season Prep
Turkey season is coming. You showed up.

Bolt-action hunting rifles and shotguns were the most-rented categories in early March. Remington 700. Benelli M2. Mossberg 500.

People stopped guessing which gun fits their hunt. They tested. Smart move.

**Slide 3:**
Week 3: Lever Action Week
Lever guns had a moment.

Henry Big Boy. Marlin 1895. Winchester 94. The lever action resurgence is real — and a lot of you found out firsthand whether you're a lever person or not.

Some of you bought Henrys. Some of you confirmed you prefer a bolt action. Both are wins.

**Slide 4:**
Week 4: Spring Carry Transition
T-shirt weather exposed a lot of winter carry setups.

P365. Hellcat Pro. Shield Plus. Glock 48. The micro-compact test drove more rentals in the last week of March than any other category.

Turns out, finding the right carry gun is personal. Who knew.

March recap.

We watched three trends play out this month:

1. Hunting prep exploded in early March. Turkey season and spring hunts drove bolt-action and shotgun rentals higher than any month this year. People are testing their rigs before the season — not during.

2. Lever actions are legit. Week 3 was our biggest lever action rental week ever. The resurgence isn't just YouTube hype. People are actually buying these — but only after they've cycled one at the range.

3. Spring carry is a real problem. Every March, the CCW community goes through the same wardrobe crisis. This year, a lot of people solved it by renting micro-compacts instead of panic-buying.

April is next. And it's a big one.

Tax refund season. That gun you've been watching videos about for 6 months? The one you've been saving for? April is when people pull the trigger (figuratively).

But before you spend your refund on something you've never shot — you know what to do.

## Tuesday, Mar 31 — April Preview / Tax Refund Season Tease

Tax refund season.

The time of year when every gun store in America sees a spike in sales. Because that direct deposit hits and suddenly the $800 rifle or $600 carry gun that's been sitting in your wishlist for 6 months feels achievable.

Here's the thing: this is the worst time to buy impulsively. You've waited this long. You've done the research. You've watched the reviews. You've read the forums.

But you still haven't shot it.

Your tax refund is real money. $1,500, $2,000, $3,000 — whatever your number is. That's not Monopoly money. It's hours of your life converted into dollars.

Spend two hours at the range first.

Rent the gun you've been eyeing. Shoot 200 rounds. Feel the trigger. Feel the recoil. Check the sights. See how it fits YOUR hands.

Then buy it with confidence.

Or discover it wasn't the one — and try the next option on your list instead.

Either way, your rental fee applies to purchase. Zero wasted dollars.

Tax refund + Rentagun = the smartest gun purchase you'll make this year.

April is going to be a big month. Stay tuned.

Tax Refund Season Is Here. What Gun Have You Been Saving For?

Every April, gun stores see a spike. Refund checks land and people buy the gun they've been eyeing for months.

Problem: most of them still haven't shot it.

You've waited 6 months. Done the research. Watched the reviews. Read the forums.

But you haven't felt the trigger. Haven't felt the recoil in YOUR hands. Haven't checked how it actually fits.

Your tax refund is real money. Hours of your life converted to dollars.

Spend 2 hours at the range first.

Rent the gun. Shoot 200 rounds. THEN buy with confidence.

Or discover it's not the one — and try the next option instead.

Your rental fee applies to purchase. Zero wasted dollars.

Tax refund + trying before buying = the smartest gun purchase you'll make this year.

April at Rentagun is going to be big. Stay tuned.
