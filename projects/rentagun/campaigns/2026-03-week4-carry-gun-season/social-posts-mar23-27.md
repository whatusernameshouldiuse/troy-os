# Rentagun Social Posts — Mar 23-27, 2026

**Theme:** Carry Gun Season (Week 4)
**Concept:** Spring is here. Jackets are coming off. That full-size pistol you've been carrying under a winter coat? It's about to print through every t-shirt and polo you own. This week addresses the annual spring carry transition — the moment every CCW holder realizes their winter setup doesn't work anymore. Rentagun's angle: instead of panic-buying a micro-compact at the gun store, rent the top 3 contenders. Carry each for a week. Find the one that disappears under YOUR clothes, with YOUR holster, at YOUR body type. The spring carry transition is one of the most relatable pain points in the concealed carry world, and it happens every single year.

**Weekly Structure:**
- Monday: Educational/Problem-Solving
- Tuesday: Inventory Spotlight
- Wednesday: Customer Story / UGC
- Thursday: Quick Tips / Hacks

**Topic:** "Spring Carry Problems: Your Winter Gun Doesn't Work Anymore"

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
Spring Carry Problems
Your Winter Gun Doesn't Work Anymore

**Slide 2:**
The Problem
All winter, you've been carrying a Glock 19, P320, or M&P 2.0 under a hoodie or jacket. It worked. The extra layers hid everything. You forgot the gun was even there.

Now it's March. The hoodie is gone. You're in a t-shirt. And that 15+1 compact is printing through your shirt like a billboard.

**Slide 3:**
Why This Happens Every Year
Winter carry and summer carry are two different games.

- Winter: Heavy fabric, multiple layers, bigger gun = no problem
- Spring/summer: Thin fabric, one layer, bigger gun = visible outline

Your carry gun didn't change. Your wardrobe did. And now your setup is compromised.

**Slide 4:**
Option 1 — Different Holster
An appendix holster with a claw/wedge combo can help a compact gun hide under a t-shirt. But not always. If you're slim, athletic, or wear fitted clothes, even the best holster can't hide a 7.5" tall gun.

**Slide 5:**
Option 2 — Smaller Gun
Micro-compacts were designed for exactly this problem. The Sig P365, Springfield Hellcat, and S&W Shield Plus are all under 6.2" tall and under 1.1" wide. They disappear under a t-shirt where a compact can't.

The trade-off: shorter sight radius, smaller grip, fewer rounds. Some people shoot micros just as well. Others lose 2-3" of accuracy at 15 yards. You won't know until you shoot one.

**Slide 6:**
Option 3 — Different Carry Position
Strong-side hip (3-4 o'clock) with a wedge holster can hide a compact under an untucked shirt. But it changes your draw stroke and comfort. AIWB (appendix) works better for some body types than others.

Point is: there's no universal answer. Your body, your clothes, your gun, your holster — they all interact differently.

**Slide 7 (CTA):**
Don't Guess. Test.
Rent 2-3 micro-compacts before spring really hits.
Carry each one for a week.
Find what disappears on YOUR body.
Link in bio.

**Caption:**
Your winter carry gun doesn't work in a t-shirt.

This isn't controversial. It happens to every concealed carrier every March.

That Glock 19 that disappeared under your North Face? It's about to print through every polo, henley, and t-shirt you own for the next 6 months.

You have three options:
1. Better holster (appendix with claw/wedge combo)
2. Smaller gun (micro-compact: P365, Hellcat, Shield Plus)
3. Different carry position (3-4 o'clock strong side)

Most people end up doing #2. The micro-compact market exists specifically because of this problem.

But here's where people mess up: they walk into the gun store in March, panic-buy a P365 because the internet said so, and hope it works.

Then they realize the grip is too short. Or the trigger doesn't feel right. Or they can't hit anything past 10 yards because the sight radius is 3 inches shorter than their Glock.

Rent first. Carry it for a week in your actual spring clothes. Go to the range. Draw from concealment. Run a mag or two.

THEN decide if it's the one.

Spring Carry Problems: Your Winter Gun Doesn't Work Anymore

Every March, the same thing happens to every concealed carrier:

The jacket comes off. The t-shirt goes on. And that compact pistol you've been hiding under a hoodie all winter is suddenly printing through your shirt.

Your gun didn't change. Your wardrobe did.

Three options:
1. Better holster — Appendix with a claw/wedge. Helps, but can't always hide a 7.5" tall gun under a single layer.
2. Smaller gun — Micro-compacts (P365, Hellcat, Shield Plus) are under 6.2" tall and 1.1" wide. They disappear where compacts can't.
3. Different carry position — Strong-side hip with a wedge holster under an untucked shirt.

Most people end up switching to a micro-compact. But which one?

That's the wrong thing to guess on. The grip length, trigger feel, sight radius, and how it prints on YOUR body are all personal. The internet can't tell you.

Rent 2-3 micro-compacts. Carry each for a week in your actual spring clothes. Find the one that works.

## Tuesday, Mar 24 — Inventory Spotlight

**Type:** Instagram Carousel (4 slides) + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Featured Gun:** Sig Sauer P365 (standard, not XL or X-Macro)
**Why this gun:** The gun that created the micro-compact category. The original P365 launched in 2018 and redefined what a carry gun could be — 10+1 in a package smaller than a Glock 43 (which only holds 6+1). It's still the gold standard spring carry gun. The standard P365 (not the XL) is the one to test for true concealment in thin clothing. At 5.8" long and 1.06" wide with a 3.1" barrel, it's the smallest Sig that still shoots well. $600 retail — not cheap for a gun you haven't carried yet.

### Instagram

**Slide 1:**
Sig Sauer P365 — 9mm
The gun that started the micro-compact revolution. Still the benchmark.

**Slide 2:**
Specs:
- Caliber: 9mm Luger
- Capacity: 10+1 (flush) / 12+1 (extended)
- Barrel: 3.1"
- Overall Length: 5.8"
- Height: 4.3"
- Width: 1.06"
- Weight: 17.8 oz (empty)
- MSRP: ~$599

**Slide 3:**
Best For:
- Spring/summer concealed carry under t-shirts, polos, or fitted clothing
- Slim or athletic builds where compact pistols print
- People who want 10+1 capacity in a sub-compact package
- Shooters transitioning from a full-size winter carry to a warm-weather gun
- Anyone who's been told "just get a P365" and wants to verify before spending $600

**Slide 4 (CTA):**
Rent the Sig P365 for 7 days.
Carry it under your actual spring clothes.
Draw from concealment at the range.
If you buy, your rental fee applies.
Link in bio.

**Caption:**
The Sig P365.

The gun that made every other manufacturer scramble to build a micro-compact.

Before the P365, your options for deep concealment were limited: Glock 43 (6+1), S&W Shield (7+1), or a pocket .380. You sacrificed capacity for size. Always.

Then Sig figured out how to fit 10+1 rounds of 9mm into a gun that's smaller than the Glock 43. That was 2018. It's still the standard every micro-compact is measured against.

Here's what matters for spring carry:
- 5.8" long, 4.3" tall, 1.06" wide — it genuinely disappears under a t-shirt
- 17.8 oz empty — you forget it's there by lunch
- 10+1 flush, 12+1 with the extended mag — real capacity in a tiny package
- The flat trigger is better than it has any right to be at this size

But here's the thing: "small" means trade-offs. The 3.1" barrel means a shorter sight radius. The grip is short — shooters with larger hands sometimes struggle to get a full grip without the pinky extension. Recoil is snappier than a compact (less mass to absorb it).

Some people carry a P365 and never look back. Others find it too small and end up at the P365X or P365XL (slightly bigger, still concealable, better shootability).

You won't know until you carry one for a week. In your clothes. At your range. With your holster.

$600 is a lot to spend on a question mark.

Sig Sauer P365 — Now Available to Rent

The gun that started the micro-compact revolution. $599 retail.

Before the P365, deep concealment meant sacrificing capacity. Glock 43 held 6+1. S&W Shield held 7+1. Then Sig fit 10+1 rounds into a gun smaller than both.

Why it works for spring carry:
- 5.8" long, 4.3" tall, 1.06" wide — disappears under a t-shirt
- 17.8 oz empty — forget it's there by lunch
- 10+1 flush mag, 12+1 extended
- Flat trigger that's better than it should be at this size

The trade-offs:
- 3.1" barrel = shorter sight radius
- Short grip — larger hands may need the pinky extension
- Snappier recoil than a compact (less mass)

Some people carry a P365 and never look back. Others find it too small and move to the P365X or P365XL.

$600 is a lot to spend on a question mark. Rent it for 7 days. Carry it in your actual spring wardrobe. Then decide.

Your rental fee applies if you buy.

Sig P365. The micro-compact that started it all.

10+1 rounds in a gun smaller than a Glock 43 (which holds 6+1).

5.8" long. 1.06" wide. 17.8 oz. Disappears under a t-shirt.

But some people find it too small. Short grip. Snappy recoil. 3.1" barrel.

$600 is a lot to spend on a maybe.

Rent it. Carry it for a week. Decide.

## Wednesday, Mar 25 — Customer Story / UGC

**Type:** Instagram Feed Post + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Format:** Testimonial from a CCW holder who went through the spring carry transition

### Instagram

**Caption:**
"I've carried a Glock 19 for three years. Four o'clock position, OWB with a cover garment. In the fall and winter, it's perfect. Hoodie, flannel, jacket — the gun vanishes.

March hit and I put on a t-shirt for the first time since October. Walked past the mirror and stopped. I looked like I was smuggling a brick on my hip.

I'd been putting off finding a summer carry gun because I love the G19. I shoot it well. I trust it. Switching to a smaller gun felt like downgrading.

But I couldn't carry a brick for 6 months.

I rented a Sig P365 first. Too small for my hands. I'm 6'2" with XL gloves — my pinky hung off the grip even with the 12-round mag. Shot it fine at the range, but the grip felt wrong for a defensive gun.

Second rental: Springfield Hellcat Pro. Better. 15+1 capacity. Slightly taller grip than the original Hellcat. I could get all four fingers on the grip. Good sights. But the trigger had a weird take-up that bugged me.

Third rental: Glock 48. That was it. Same grip angle as my G19 (muscle memory carried over). 10+1 in a slim package. 1.1" wide. It disappeared under a t-shirt at appendix where my G19 never could.

The G48 felt like my G19 went on a diet. Everything I liked, just thinner.

Bought the G48 MOS after the rental. My Glock 19 is now my November-through-February gun. The G48 runs March through October.

Rental fee applied to purchase. Three weeks of testing vs buying blind."
— Derek L., Virginia

Three rentals. Three weeks. Found his spring carry gun.

And he didn't sacrifice the things that mattered to him: grip angle, muscle memory, capacity, confidence.

That's the point. "Best carry gun" lists are useless because they don't account for YOUR hands, YOUR body, YOUR wardrobe, YOUR training.

Rent the finalists. Carry them. The gun picks itself.

Real story from a Rentagun member:

"I've carried a Glock 19 for three years. OWB at four o'clock under a jacket. Worked perfectly October through February.

March hit. Put on a t-shirt. Looked like I was smuggling a brick.

I love the G19 — I shoot it well, I trust it. Switching to a smaller gun felt like downgrading.

But I couldn't carry a brick for 6 months.

Rental 1: Sig P365. Too small. I'm 6'2" with XL hands — pinky hung off the grip.

Rental 2: Springfield Hellcat Pro. Better grip, 15+1 capacity. But the trigger had a weird take-up.

Rental 3: Glock 48. That was it. Same grip angle as my G19 — muscle memory carried over. 10+1 in a 1.1"-wide package. Disappeared at appendix under a t-shirt.

Bought the G48 MOS. Rental fee applied. My G19 is now my winter gun. The G48 runs March through October."

## Thursday, Mar 26 — Quick Tips

**Type:** Instagram Carousel (7 slides) + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Topic:** "The Spring Carry Tryout: 3 Micro-Compacts to Rent Before Summer"

### Instagram

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
The Spring Carry Tryout
3 Micro-Compacts to Rent Before Summer

**Slide 2:**
Why You Need to Do This
Every CCW holder goes through the spring transition. But most people handle it wrong: they read reviews for 3 weeks, buy one gun based on internet consensus, and hope it works.

That's a $500-$700 gamble on something that needs to fit your hands, your body, your wardrobe, and your shooting style.

Better approach: rent all three. One week each. Three weeks total. Know the answer.

**Slide 3:**
Contender 1 — Sig P365 (Standard)
10+1 flush / 12+1 extended | 3.1" barrel | 17.8 oz

The benchmark. Smallest 10+ round 9mm you can buy. Flat trigger. Night sights standard. XRAY3 day/night sights.

Best for: Small frames, deep concealment, people who want maximum capacity in minimum size.

Watch for: Short grip if you have large hands. Snappy recoil with hot defensive ammo.

**Slide 4:**
Contender 2 — Springfield Hellcat Pro
15+1 capacity | 3.7" barrel | 21.5 oz

The capacity king. 15+1 in a micro-compact frame. The Pro version has a taller grip than the original Hellcat — easier to get a full grip. Slightly larger than the P365 but packs 5 more rounds.

Best for: People who refuse to sacrifice capacity. Larger hands that need more grip.

Watch for: Aggressive grip texture can chafe without an undershirt. Trigger is polarizing — some love it, some don't.

**Slide 5:**
Contender 3 — S&W Shield Plus
13+1 capacity | 3.1" barrel | 20.2 oz

The value play. 13+1 rounds. Flat-face trigger that most people love. S&W's fit and finish at a $450-$500 street price — the most affordable of the three.

Best for: Budget-conscious carriers. People who like a flat trigger. Anyone who wants to test a micro-compact without spending P365/Hellcat money on the rental.

Watch for: Slightly wider than P365 (1.1" vs 1.06"). Sights are basic — most people upgrade.

**Slide 6:**
How to Run the Tryout
Week 1: Rent Gun A. Carry it every day in your spring/summer clothes. Go to the range. Run 100 rounds. Draw from concealment 20 times.

Week 2: Rent Gun B. Same routine. Same clothes. Same holster position.

Week 3: Rent Gun C. Same routine.

End of week 3: You'll know which one felt best. Not which one the internet likes — which one YOUR body and YOUR hands chose.

**Slide 7 (CTA):**
The Spring Carry Tryout
3 guns. 3 weeks. 1 answer.
Your rental fees apply to purchase.
Stop guessing. Start carrying.
Link in bio.

**Caption:**
The spring carry tryout. Three guns. Three weeks. One answer.

Sig P365 — 10+1. The smallest. The benchmark.
Springfield Hellcat Pro — 15+1. The capacity king.
S&W Shield Plus — 13+1. The value play.

These are the three guns that show up in every "best carry gun" article. They're all good. They're all different.

The P365 is the smallest but might be too small for your hands. The Hellcat Pro has the most capacity but the grip texture might chafe. The Shield Plus is the best value but the sights are basic.

None of that matters until you carry one for a week.

Not shoot it once at the store counter.
Not watch a 10-minute YouTube review.
Not read a forum thread from 2019.

Carry it. Monday through Sunday. Under your actual clothes. To the grocery store, the office, the range.

Then switch to the next one. Same routine. Same holster. Same clothes.

After three weeks, you won't need anyone's opinion. You'll have yours.

Save this post for when you're ready.

10+1 flush. Smallest 10+ round 9mm. The benchmark.
Best for: Deep concealment, small frames.
Watch for: Short grip, snappy recoil.

Contender 2 — Springfield Hellcat Pro
15+1 capacity. The Pro has a taller grip than the original.

Contender 3 — S&W Shield Plus
13+1 rounds. Flat-face trigger. $450-500 street price.
Best for: Budget-conscious, flat trigger fans.
Watch for: Slightly wider, basic sights.

How to run it:
Week 1: Carry Gun A daily. Range day. 100 rounds. 20 concealment draws.
Week 2: Carry Gun B. Same routine.
Week 3: Carry Gun C. Same routine.

After 3 weeks you'll know which one YOUR body and YOUR hands chose.

## Friday, Mar 27 — Weekend Inspiration

**Type:** Instagram Feed Post + Stories + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Topic:** "Weekend Mission: Find Your Spring Carry Gun"

### Instagram

**Caption:**
Weekend mission. Simple one.

Go to your closet. Pull out the t-shirt, polo, or button-down you wear most from April through September.

Put it on.

Now put on your carry gun and holster.

Stand in front of the mirror. Turn sideways. Bend over. Reach up like you're grabbing something off a shelf. Sit down in a chair.

If you can see the outline of your gun in ANY of those positions — your spring carry setup needs work.

You have two choices:
1. Hope nobody notices for 6 months
2. Fix it now while you have time

Fixing it means testing what actually works. Not what the internet says works — what works on YOUR body, in YOUR clothes, with YOUR holster.

This weekend:
- Rent a micro-compact you've been considering
- Put on your spring/summer outfit
- Go to the range
- Draw from concealment 20 times
- Run 50 rounds
- Walk around for an hour and see if you notice it

That's a Saturday morning. Two hours. And you'll have real data instead of forum opinions.

Spring is here. Your wardrobe is changing. Your carry setup should change with it.

**Story 1:**
Mirror test time.
Put on your spring outfit + your carry gun.
Turn sideways.

Can you see it?

[Poll sticker]
- Nope, I'm good
- ...yeah, it prints
- I've been avoiding this
- I don't carry yet

**Story 2:**
If you picked "yeah, it prints" — you're not alone.

Every March, thousands of CCW holders discover their winter gun doesn't work in spring clothes.

The fix isn't complicated. You need a gun that fits your warm-weather wardrobe.

**Story 3:**
The spring carry swap:

Winter setup: Glock 19, P320, M&P 2.0 under a jacket

Spring setup: P365, Hellcat, Shield Plus, or G48 under a t-shirt

Same confidence. Smaller package.

**Story 4:**
Weekend mission:

1. Spring outfit on
2. Rent a micro-compact
3. Holster up
4. Range time: 50 rounds
5. Concealment draws: 20 reps
6. Walk around for an hour

That's 2 hours on a Saturday to solve a 6-month problem.

**Concealed carry context (for content accuracy):**
- Sig P365: Launched 2018, created the modern micro-compact category. 10+1 in a sub-compact frame was revolutionary.
- Springfield Hellcat: Launched 2019 as a P365 competitor. 11+1 standard, 13+1 extended. The Pro version (2022) adds a taller grip and 15+1 capacity.
- S&W Shield Plus: Launched 2021. Updated the M&P Shield with 13+1 capacity. Most affordable of the three at ~$450-500 street price.
- Glock 48: Not a micro-compact — it's a "slimline" compact. Same grip length as a G19 but only 1.1" wide. 10+1. Appeals to G19 carriers who want the same manual of arms in a thinner package.
- The spring carry transition is one of the most discussed topics in the CCW community every year (March-April). Extremely relatable.
