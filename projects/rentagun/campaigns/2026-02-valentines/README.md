## Campaign Summary

**Theme:** Valentine's Day as a couples/gift experience — not flowers, not chocolate, but 7 days at the range with a gun they've been wanting to try.

**4 Gift Ideas Pushed Throughout:**
1. **The Classic Date** — Two handguns, couples range day (Sig P365XL + Glock 19)
2. **The Bucket List** — One dream gun (Desert Eagle, Python, S&W 500)
3. **The First Timer** — Intro gun for someone curious (M&P Shield EZ)
4. **The Hunter's Valentine** — Rent-before-you-buy for upcoming hunts

**Key Deadline:** Order by Feb 11 for Valentine's Day weekend FFL delivery
