### Section 3: Social Proof

**Section Header:**
What Renters Are Saying

> "My husband always goes to the range alone. I told him I wanted to try. He signed us up, we picked two guns, and spent Saturday at the range together. Best date we've had in 3 years."
> — Sarah K., Georgia

> "I was 100% set on buying a Glock 19. Rented it through Rentagun. Turns out, my hands are too small. Ended up trying a P365XL next — perfect fit. Saved me from a $600 mistake."
> — Mike T., Birmingham

> "Got my dad a rental of a 1911 for Father's Day. He talked about it for 6 months. Best gift I ever gave him."
> — Jake R., Tennessee

### Section 4: FAQ

**Q: Can I really rent a gun and have it shipped to me?**
A: Yes. All rentals ship to a licensed FFL dealer near you. You complete a standard background check (ATF Form 4473) at pickup — same as buying a gun at any store. 100% legal. 100% compliant.

**Q: What if they don't like the gun?**
A: Perfect. That's the whole point. Send it back with the prepaid label. No commitment. Try something else next time.

**Q: Will it arrive by Valentine's Day?**
A: Orders placed by Feb 11 will arrive at your FFL by Valentine's Day weekend. After that, we'll do our best but can't guarantee timing.

**Q: Can I gift a rental to someone else?**
A: Yes! Place the order with their FFL. They'll complete the background check at pickup. You can email or print the confirmation as the "gift reveal."

**Q: Do you ship to all 50 states?**
A: We ship to 37 states. California and 12 other states with restrictive transfer laws are excluded. Check availability at checkout.

BROWSE VALENTINE'S RENTALS
