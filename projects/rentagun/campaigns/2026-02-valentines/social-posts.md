Rent two handguns. Hit the range together. Argue about which one shoots better.

THE BUCKET LIST
Rent that one gun you've always wanted to shoot. Split the ammo. Take turns.
(Recommended: Desert Eagle .50 AE)

THE FIRST TIMER
Know someone who's curious? Rent them something easy to shoot. Be their guide.
(Recommended: S&W M&P Shield EZ)

**Slide 5:**
THE HUNTER'S VALENTINE
Got a hunt coming up? Rent the rifle first. 7 days of range time beats buying blind.

That's a Valentine's gift with some personality.

⏰ Last call.

If you want your Valentine's rental at the FFL by this weekend, order today.

After today, we can't guarantee it arrives in time.

Don't be the person scrambling at CVS on Friday night.

Be the person who hands their Valentine a rental confirmation for a Desert Eagle.
