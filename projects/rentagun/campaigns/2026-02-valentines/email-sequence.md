## Email 1: The Tease
**Send Date:** Friday, Feb 7
**Subject Line:** The Valentine's gift she won't return
**Preview Text:** (No, it's not jewelry.)

```
Hey [First Name],

Valentine's Day is next Friday.

If you're staring at your phone right now thinking "what do I get them?" — I've got an idea that isn't flowers, chocolate, or a restaurant reservation they'll forget by March.

Give them range time with a gun they've always wanted to try.

Or better yet: rent two, go together, and turn it into the most memorable date you've had in years.

Here's how it works:
- Pick a gun (or two) from our catalog
- We ship to your local FFL
- Spend 7 days at the range together
- Return with the prepaid label

No commitment. No buyer's remorse. Just a damn good time.

3 combos that make great Valentine's gifts:

1. THE CLASSIC DATE — Rent a Sig P365XL and a Glock 19. Shoot both. Argue about which one's better. (This is flirting for gun people.)

2. THE BUCKET LIST — Rent a Desert Eagle .50 AE. Split the ammo. Take turns. Post the slow-mo video.

3. THE FIRST TIMER — Know someone who's been curious? Rent a Smith & Wesson M&P Shield EZ. Low recoil. Easy rack. Perfect intro gun.

Seriously. The bar for Valentine's gifts is on the floor. This clears it by a mile.

P.S. Order by Tuesday the 11th to have your rental at the FFL by Valentine's Day weekend.

Quick story:

Last Valentine's Day, a couple from Georgia rented a Beretta 92FS and a CZ 75.

Her review:

"My husband always goes to the range alone. I told him I wanted to try. He signed us up for Rentagun, we picked two guns, and spent Saturday at the range together. It was the best date we've had in 3 years. I outshot him with the CZ. He's still mad."

That's what a good Valentine's gift looks like.

Not something that sits in a drawer. Something you DO together.

And here's the thing: you don't need to be a couple. This works for:

- Your shooting buddy who's been eyeing a new carry gun
- Your dad who talks about the 1911 he "almost bought" every Thanksgiving
- Your friend who keeps saying "I should learn to shoot"

A Rentagun gift is basically saying: "I got you 7 days with a gun you've been thinking about."

Hard to beat that.

## Email 3: The Last Call
**Send Date:** Thursday, Feb 13
**Subject Line:** Tomorrow is Valentine's Day. You ready?
**Preview Text:** There's still time.

```
[First Name],

Valentine's Day is tomorrow.

If you still don't have a gift: I can help.

Here's the play:

1. Go to rentagun.com right now
2. Pick a gun (takes 5 minutes)
3. We'll get it to your FFL by this weekend

You'll hand them a confirmation email that says "I rented you a [Gun Name] for 7 days."

That's a gift with personality. That's a gift that says "I actually thought about what you'd enjoy."

Not a candle. Not socks. Not a gift card to Olive Garden.

Range time with a gun they've been talking about.

Happy Valentine's Day. Go make it count.

P.S. Even if it arrives Saturday instead of Friday, you're still the hero. Trust me.
