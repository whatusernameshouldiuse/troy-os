**Slide 1 (Cover):**
5 Reasons Spring Is the Best Time to Rent a Gun

**Slide 2:**
#1 — Outdoor Ranges Are Open Again
Indoor ranges have their place. But shooting outdoors at 25, 50, 100 yards? That's where you really learn what a gun can do. Spring weather = no more excuses.

**Slide 3:**
#2 — You've Done the Research All Winter
You've been on Reddit, YouTube, and every forum since November. You've got a shortlist. Now put hands on it. Rent the finalists. End the debate.

**Slide 4:**
#3 — Hunting Season Is Coming
Turkey season. Spring hunts. Fall prep starts now. If you're buying a new hunting rifle or shotgun, rent it first. $100 rental vs $1,500 mistake.

**Slide 5:**
#4 — Your Carry Setup Needs a Spring Update
Winter jacket hides a full-size. March t-shirt doesn't. Time to test micro-compacts before summer hits. Rent 2-3 carry options. Find what conceals.

**Slide 6:**
#5 — New Inventory Just Dropped
We added long guns, lever actions, and shotguns to the catalog. Not just handguns anymore. There's never been more to try.

**Slide 7 (CTA):**
Stop researching. Start shooting.
Spring range season is here.
Rent your first gun for 7 days.
Link in bio.

**Caption:**
You spent all winter doing "research."

Reddit threads. YouTube reviews. Forum debates. Spreadsheets (don't lie, you made one).

Here's the truth: you still don't know which gun is right until you shoot it.

Spring is the best time to fix that. Here's why:

1. Outdoor ranges are open again
2. You've already done the homework — time for the hands-on test
3. Hunting season is coming — test your rig before the hunt
4. Your carry setup needs a spring update (lighter clothes = smaller gun)
5. New long guns, lever actions, and shotguns just hit the catalog

Pick one. Rent it for 7 days. Take it to an outdoor range. Decide.

That's how smart shooters do it.

## Tuesday, Mar 3 — Inventory Spotlight

**Type:** Instagram Carousel (4 slides) + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Featured Gun:** Remington 700 SPS
**Why this gun:** Iconic hunting rifle. Turkey/spring season approaching. Shows catalog depth beyond handguns. The "should I get a 700 or a Tikka" debate rages constantly. Let them rent and decide.

### Instagram

**Slide 1:**
Remington 700 SPS
The most debated bolt action in America. Time to settle it yourself.

**Slide 2:**

- Caliber: .308 Win (also available in .30-06, .270)
- Barrel: 24"
- Weight: 7.25 lbs
- Action: Bolt
- Trigger: X-Mark Pro (adjustable)

**Slide 3:**
Best For:
- Deer, elk, and general big-game hunting
- Shooters debating Remington 700 vs Tikka T3x
- Anyone who wants to test a bolt action before dropping $800+
- Precision rifle beginners looking for a platform to build on

**Slide 4 (CTA):**
Rent the Remington 700 SPS for 7 days.
Take it to the range. Shoot 100 rounds.
If you buy it, your rental fee applies.
Link in bio.

**Caption:**
The Remington 700.

More deer have been taken with this rifle than probably any bolt action in history. There's a reason.

But here's the thing: the 700 vs Tikka T3x debate has been raging for 20 years. Forum posts. YouTube comparisons. Heated arguments at gun counters.

You know what settles it? Shooting both.

The trigger feel. The bolt throw. How it shoulders. Where the groups land at 100 yards with YOUR ammo.

That's data. Not opinions.

Rent the 700 this month. If the Tikka's next on your list, rent that too.

7 days each. Real range time. Real data. Your decision.

## Wednesday, Mar 4 — Customer Story / UGC

**Type:** Instagram Feed Post + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Format:** Testimonial-style post with hunting angle

### Instagram

**Caption:**
"I was ready to buy a Weatherby Vanguard for elk season. $750. Everyone said it was a solid choice.

But I'd never shot a bolt-action rifle before. Only ARs and handguns.

Rented a Remington 700 through Rentagun. Took it to the outdoor range.

First thing I noticed: the bolt throw felt off for me. Short and stiff. Not bad — just not what I expected.

Rented a Tikka T3x the next month. Butter-smooth bolt. Different stock feel. Groups were tighter — or maybe I just shot it better because it fit me.

Ended up buying the Tikka. Never would've known without shooting both.

$200 in rentals saved me from $750 on the wrong rifle. And now I actually trust my hunting rig instead of hoping it works."
— Ryan M., Montana

That's the point.

Hunting rifles aren't something you can "feel" at a gun counter. The bolt, the trigger, the cheek weld, the balance — you need rounds downrange.

$200 in rentals. $0 in regret.

Real story from a Rentagun member:

"I was ready to buy a Weatherby Vanguard for elk season. $750. Everyone said it was solid.

But I'd never shot a bolt action before. Only ARs and handguns.

Rented a Remington 700. Then a Tikka T3x. Completely different feel. The Tikka's bolt was butter-smooth. Groups were tighter.

Bought the Tikka. $200 in rentals saved me from $750 on the wrong rifle."

## Thursday, Mar 5 — Quick Tips

**Type:** Instagram Carousel (7 slides) + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Topic:** "How to Pick a Hunting Rifle Without Spending $1,800 on the Wrong One"

### Instagram

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
How to Pick a Hunting Rifle Without Spending $1,800 on the Wrong One

**Slide 2:**
Step 1: Know Your Caliber
Match the caliber to your game. Deer? .308 or .30-06. Elk? .300 Win Mag. Varmint? .223. Turkey? 12 gauge, 3" chamber. Don't overbuy. Don't underbuy.

**Slide 3:**
Step 2: Narrow to 2-3 Models
Forums, reviews, and YouTube will get you to 2-3 finalists. That's the easy part. Picking from those 3? That's where most people get stuck.

**Slide 4:**
Step 3: Rent the Finalists
$75-150 per rental. Shoot each one for 7 days. 100+ rounds minimum. At an outdoor range if possible — indoor doesn't tell you what you need for hunting.

**Slide 5:**
Step 4: Test What Matters
Forget the spec sheet. Test these in person:
- Bolt feel (smooth or gritty?)
- Trigger break (clean or mushy?)
- Cheek weld with YOUR face
- Recoil with YOUR ammo
- Balance when carrying

**Slide 6:**
Step 5: Compare Your Notes
After renting 2-3 rifles, you'll have REAL data. Not forum opinions. Not YouTube thumbnails. Your own hands, eyes, and shoulder told you the answer.

**Slide 7 (CTA):**
Total cost: $200-400 in rentals.
Total saved: $800-1,800 on the wrong rifle.
Your rental fee applies if you buy.
Link in bio to start.

**Caption:**
Most people pick a hunting rifle one of two ways:

A) Buy whatever the guy at the counter recommends
B) Spend 6 months on forums and still guess

Both end the same way: "I wish I'd tried it first."

Here's the 5-step method that actually works:

1. Know your caliber (match the game, not the hype)
2. Narrow to 2-3 finalists (forums get you this far)
3. Rent the finalists (7 days each, 100+ rounds)
4. Test what matters (bolt feel, trigger break, cheek weld, recoil, balance)
5. Compare real data (your hands > forum opinions)

$200-400 in rentals vs $1,800 on the wrong rifle.

Save this for when you're ready to buy.

## Friday, Mar 6 — Weekend Inspiration

**Type:** Instagram Feed Post + Stories + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Topic:** "First Outdoor Range Day of the Year"

### Instagram

**Caption:**
Spring range season is officially here.

If you haven't been to an outdoor range since last fall, this weekend is the one.

Here's the move:

Pick a gun you've been thinking about. Maybe it's a bolt-action you've been researching for months. Maybe it's a carry gun you want to test in a t-shirt instead of a jacket. Maybe it's something off the bucket list.

Rent it. Drive to the outdoor range. Set up at the 50 or the 100. Spend two hours doing actual research — not the internet kind.

By Sunday, you'll know more about that gun than any YouTube video could tell you.

Rent it Saturday. Decide Sunday.

What are you taking to the range this weekend? Drop your pick below.
