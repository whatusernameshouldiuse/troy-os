# Rentagun Social Posts — Mar 16-20, 2026

**Theme:** Lever Action Week (Week 3)
**Concept:** The lever action resurgence is real. Henry, Marlin (post-Ruger revival), and Winchester have all seen a surge in interest. Younger shooters are discovering them through cowboy action shooting, hunting, and the sheer satisfaction of cycling a lever. Older shooters already know. This week positions Rentagun as the way to try the ones you've been eyeing — without dropping $800-$2,000 on a gun you've only seen behind glass. Mix nostalgia with practical use cases: deer hunting, brush guns, home defense, and the pure fun factor.

**Weekly Structure:**
- Monday: Educational/Problem-Solving
- Tuesday: Inventory Spotlight
- Wednesday: Customer Story / UGC
- Thursday: Quick Tips / Hacks
- Friday: Weekend Inspiration

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
The Lever Action Resurgence
Why Everyone's Going Back to Lever Guns

**Slide 2:**
They Never Left
Your grandpa's deer rifle. The gun that won the West. Lever actions have been around since 1860. But in the past 5 years? Sales have exploded. Here's why shooters are going back to the lever.

**Slide 3:**
Reason 1 — They're Legal Almost Everywhere
No magazine capacity debates. No "assault weapon" classification. No feature bans. Lever actions fly under every state restriction. From California to New York — you can own one without a headache. That matters.

**Slide 4:**
Reason 2 — They're Legitimate Brush Guns
Short barrel. Fast handling. Pistol-caliber options (.357 Mag, .44 Mag, .45-70 Govt) hit hard at close range. Perfect for thick timber, swamps, and anywhere a 24" bolt gun is too long. Deer hunters in the East have known this for 150 years.

**Slide 5:**
Reason 3 — The Fun Factor Is Unmatched
Cycling a lever action is one of the most satisfying things in shooting. The mechanical clack. The smooth feed. The "cowboy" feeling you can't get from a semi-auto. Shooters who buy lever guns for hunting end up bringing them to the range every weekend.

**Slide 6:**
Reason 4 — Marlin Is Back
Ruger bought Marlin out of bankruptcy and relaunched the 1895 and 336. The new Marlins are getting rave reviews — better fit and finish than the late-Remington era. People are curious. But at $1,100-$1,400, "curious" is an expensive gamble.

**Slide 7 (CTA):**
Curious about lever actions?
Rent one before you spend $800-$2,000.
Henry. Marlin. Winchester.
7 days. Your range. Your decision.

**Caption:**
Lever actions are having a moment.

And by "moment" I mean sales are up, waiting lists are growing, and every gun channel on YouTube has done a lever gun video in the past 6 months.

Here's why:
1. Legal in all 50 states. No capacity bans. No feature restrictions.
2. Legitimate brush guns — .357 Mag, .44 Mag, .45-70 in a short package that handles in thick timber.
3. The fun factor is unmatched. Cycling a lever action at the range is pure satisfaction.
4. Marlin is back. Ruger relaunched the 1895 and 336 and people are paying attention.

But here's the thing — lever guns aren't cheap. Henry Big Boy runs $800-$1,000. A Marlin 1895 SBL is $1,200+. Winchester Model 94 starts around $1,400.

That's a lot to spend on "I think I want a lever gun."

Rent one. Cycle it. Shoot it. Decide.

The Lever Action Resurgence — Why Everyone's Going Back

Lever actions are having a moment. Sales are up, waiting lists are growing, and younger shooters are discovering what your grandpa already knew.

Why now?

1. Legal everywhere. No magazine capacity issues. No feature bans. California to New York, you can own one.
2. Legitimate brush guns. .357 Mag, .44 Mag, .45-70 Govt in a short, fast-handling package for thick timber.
3. The fun factor. Cycling a lever action is one of the most satisfying feelings in shooting.
4. Marlin is back. Ruger relaunched the 1895 and 336 to rave reviews.

But lever guns aren't cheap. Henry Big Boy: $800-$1,000. Marlin 1895 SBL: $1,200+. Winchester Model 94: $1,400+.

That's a lot to spend on curiosity.

Rent one. Cycle it. Shoot it. Decide.

## Tuesday, Mar 17 — Inventory Spotlight

**Type:** Instagram Carousel (4 slides) + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Featured Gun:** Henry Big Boy Steel (.357 Magnum / .38 Special)
**Why this gun:** The most popular lever action gateway drug. .357 Mag is versatile (shares ammo with .38 Special revolvers). Henry's fit and finish is legendary. $800-$1,000 price point is accessible but still worth testing before buying. The "side loading gate" debate (older Henrys required tube-loading) is settled — newer models have the gate. Perfect for the curious shooter.

### Instagram

**Slide 1:**
Henry Big Boy Steel — .357 Mag / .38 Spl
The lever action everyone recommends first. Time to find out if they're right.

**Slide 2:**
Specs:
- Caliber: .357 Magnum / .38 Special
- Capacity: 10+1 (.38 Spl) / 7+1 (.357 Mag)
- Barrel: 20"
- Weight: 7.4 lbs
- Action: Lever action with side loading gate
- MSRP: ~$949

**Slide 3:**
Best For:
- First-time lever action shooters (affordable, smooth, forgiving)
- Revolver owners who want a rifle that shares ammo (.357/.38)
- Deer hunters wanting a brush gun under 100 yards
- Anyone who's watched one too many cowboy movies and needs to scratch the itch
- Home defense (yes, .357 Mag from a 20" barrel is serious)

**Slide 4 (CTA):**
Rent the Henry Big Boy for 7 days.
Load .38 Specials for fun. Load .357 Mag for authority.
If you buy, your rental fee applies.
Link in bio.

**Caption:**
The Henry Big Boy in .357 Magnum.

If you've been anywhere near lever action discussions, this name comes up first. And for good reason.

It shoots .357 Mag AND .38 Special — same gun, two personalities. Load .38 Specials for a soft-shooting, cheap range day. Load .357 Mag for deer, hogs, or home defense out of a 20" barrel (the ballistics from a rifle-length barrel are no joke — .357 from a lever gun is a different animal than .357 from a 4" revolver).

The action is smooth. Henry's quality control is borderline obsessive. The newer models have the side loading gate so you're not stuck tube-loading like the old ones.

At $949, it's one of the more affordable lever guns. But "affordable" is relative when you haven't shot one yet.

Some people cycle a lever action and fall in love immediately. Others realize they prefer a bolt gun or semi-auto. Both are valid — but you won't know until you feel it.

Rent it. Load it up. Cycle that lever. See if the hype is real.

Henry Big Boy Steel (.357 Mag / .38 Spl) — Now Available to Rent

The lever action everyone recommends first. $949 retail.

Why everyone talks about this gun:
- Shoots .357 Mag AND .38 Special (two calibers, one gun)
- .38 Spl for cheap range days, .357 Mag for deer, hogs, home defense
- Henry's fit and finish is borderline obsessive
- Side loading gate on newer models (no more tube-loading only)
- Smooth action that makes every other lever gun feel rough

Here's the thing: some people cycle a lever action and fall in love. Others realize they prefer a bolt gun. Both are valid.

$949 is a lot to spend to find out.

Rent it for 7 days. Load it up. Feel the action. Then decide.

Your rental fee applies if you buy.

## Wednesday, Mar 18 — Customer Story / UGC

**Type:** Instagram Feed Post + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Format:** Testimonial from a shooter who discovered lever actions through a rental

### Instagram

**Caption:**
"I'm 28. I grew up shooting ARs and Glocks. That's what my dad had. That's what all my friends shoot.

A buddy showed me his Henry .45-70 at the range last year. I thought it was cool but assumed lever actions were just cowboy nostalgia. Museum pieces.

Then I actually shot it.

The feel of cycling that lever. The way the .45-70 thumps your shoulder — not sharp like a magnum rifle, just a deep push. The simplicity of it. No magazines to fumble. No charging handle. Just load, lever, shoot.

I went home and started researching. Henry Big Boy. Marlin 336. Winchester 94. Prices ranged from $800 to $1,800. I didn't know which one was right and I wasn't about to buy three.

Rented the Henry Big Boy in .357 first through Rentagun. Loved the action, loved how smooth it was. But I wanted more power for hog hunting.

Second rental: Marlin 1895 SBL in .45-70. That was the one. The Ruger-made Marlin felt solid. The .45-70 from a lever gun is like nothing else.

Bought the Marlin. My rental fees applied.

Three weeks of trying two guns vs blind-buying a $1,300 rifle based on YouTube reviews. Easy call."
— Chris M., Texas

Two rentals. Three weeks. Found the right lever gun.

That's how it's supposed to work. You wouldn't buy a truck without test driving two or three. Why would a rifle be any different?

Real story from a Rentagun member:

"I'm 28. Grew up shooting ARs and Glocks. Thought lever actions were cowboy nostalgia.

Then I shot a buddy's Henry .45-70. The feel of cycling that lever. The deep push of the recoil. The simplicity. No magazines. No charging handle. Just load, lever, shoot.

Started researching. Prices ranged from $800-$1,800. Didn't know which one was right.

Rented a Henry Big Boy in .357 first. Smooth, loved it. But wanted more power for hog hunting.

Second rental: Marlin 1895 SBL in .45-70. That was the one.

Bought the Marlin. Rental fees applied.

Three weeks and two rentals vs blind-buying a $1,300 rifle from YouTube reviews."

## Thursday, Mar 19 — Quick Tips

**Type:** Instagram Carousel (7 slides) + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Topic:** "Lever Action Caliber Guide: Which Round Is Right for You?"

### Instagram

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
Lever Action Caliber Guide
Which Round Is Right for You?

**Slide 2:**
.22 LR — The Trainer
Henry Golden Boy, Marlin 39A
Perfect for: Teaching new shooters, plinking, small game. Cheap to shoot (5-10 cents/round). Zero recoil. If you want to learn lever action mechanics without the noise or cost, start here.
Range: 75 yards max (effective)

**Slide 3:**
.357 Magnum / .38 Special — The Versatile Pick
Henry Big Boy, Marlin 1894
Perfect for: Do-everything lever gun. Load .38 Spl for cheap range days (~30 cents/round). Load .357 Mag for deer under 100 yards, hogs, or home defense. Shares ammo with .357 revolvers. Best first lever action for most people.
Range: 100-125 yards

**Slide 4:**
.44 Magnum — The Step Up
Henry Big Boy, Marlin 1894
Perfect for: Hunters who need more energy than .357. Excellent for deer, black bear, and hogs. More recoil and cost than .357, but significantly more terminal energy. The classic guide gun caliber.
Range: 125-150 yards

**Slide 5:**
.45-70 Government — The Hammer
Marlin 1895, Henry Steel .45-70
Perfect for: Anything in North America. Elk, moose, bear, hogs, dinosaurs (probably). Heavy recoil. Expensive ammo ($1.50-$3/round). Not a range plinker — this is a hunting cartridge. But from a lever gun? It's an experience.
Range: 150-200 yards

**Slide 6:**
.30-30 Winchester — The Classic Deer Round
Marlin 336, Winchester Model 94
Perfect for: Whitetail deer inside 200 yards. The most deer taken by any cartridge in American history. Moderate recoil. Affordable ammo (~$1/round). If you hunt in the woods, not the plains, the .30-30 is the answer your grandpa already gave you.
Range: 150-200 yards

**Slide 7 (CTA):**
Not sure which caliber?
Rent two. Different calibers. Same range day.
Compare recoil, noise, accuracy, and how they feel in YOUR hands.
That's data. Not a forum debate.
Link in bio.

**Caption:**
Lever action caliber breakdown:

.22 LR — The trainer. Cheap, no recoil, learn the action.
.357 Mag — The versatile pick. Cheap plinking with .38 Spl, serious stopping power with .357.
.44 Mag — The step up. More energy for deer and hogs.
.45-70 Govt — The hammer. Anything in North America. Heavy recoil, heavy results.
.30-30 Win — The classic. More deer taken with this than any cartridge in history.

Each one feels completely different in a lever action. The recoil profile, the cycling speed, the noise — it's not interchangeable.

Reading specs won't tell you how .45-70 pushes your shoulder vs how .357 snaps. Only shooting them will.

Rent two different calibers. Same range day. Compare. That's how you pick the right one.

Save this for reference.

### Instagram

**Caption:**
This is your sign.

That lever action you've been watching videos about? The Henry Big Boy your buddy keeps telling you to buy? The Marlin 1895 you've had in a browser tab for three weeks?

Stop watching. Start shooting.

This weekend, do this:

1. Rent a lever gun through Rentagun
2. Grab a box of ammo (or two)
3. Head to your local range
4. Cycle that lever 50 times
5. Feel the difference between reading about it and shooting it

Some of you will cycle that lever and immediately understand the hype. The mechanical click. The smooth feed. The feeling of shooting something that isn't made of polymer.

Some of you will cycle it and think "cool, but I still prefer my AR." That's fine too. Better to know now than after spending $1,200.

Either way, you'll have an answer. Not an opinion from Reddit — YOUR answer from YOUR range time.

Weekend mission: rent a lever gun. Settle it.
