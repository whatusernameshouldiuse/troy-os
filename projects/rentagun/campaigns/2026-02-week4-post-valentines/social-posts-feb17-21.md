## Monday, Feb 17 — Educational / Problem-Solving

**Platform:** Instagram Carousel (4 slides)
**Theme:** "How to choose between 2 guns you're stuck on"

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
"Stuck between two guns? Here's what to do."

**Slide 2:**
"Step 1: Define your purpose"
Home defense? Concealed carry? Range fun? The answer narrows your list fast.

**Slide 3:**
"Step 2: Stop watching YouTube reviews"
No video replaces trigger feel, grip fit, and recoil in YOUR hands. Specs don't tell the whole story.

**Slide 4:**
"Step 3: Rent both. Decide with data."
7 days each. Side-by-side comparison. Your rental fee applies if you buy.
[CTA: Link in bio]

**Caption:**
```
You've been going back and forth for weeks.

Glock 19 vs Sig P365?
CZ P-10 vs M&P Shield?
AR-15 vs Mini-14?

Here's the thing: specs on paper won't tell you which one fits YOUR hands.

Rent both. Shoot both. 7 days each.

Your rental fee applies to purchase if you fall in love.

Stop researching. Start shooting.

**Twitter/X:**
```
The internet can't tell you which gun fits your hand.

Rent it. Shoot it. 7 days of real data beats 7 months of forum debates.

## Tuesday, Feb 18 — Inventory Spotlight

**Platform:** Instagram Feed (single image post)
**Featured Gun:** Sig Sauer P365XL

**Caption:**
```
The Sig P365XL.

10+1 rounds in a micro-compact frame. This is the gun that changed the concealed carry market.

But here's the real question: does it fit YOUR hand?

Specs say it's 6.6" long and 20.7 oz. Reviews say it's the best carry gun under $600.

Your hands say... well, you won't know until you shoot it.

Available to rent now. 7 days. Ship to your local FFL.

Your rental fee applies to purchase.

## Wednesday, Feb 19 — Customer Story / UGC

**Platform:** Instagram Feed
**Theme:** "I was going to buy the wrong gun"

**Caption:**
```
Real talk from a Rentagun member:

"I was dead set on a full-size 1911 for home defense. Shot one at the range once, loved the feel.

Then I rented one through Rentagun for a week. Turns out, clearing a hallway at 2am with a 5-inch barrel and 39 oz of steel isn't as fun as the range.

I rented a Glock 19 next. Half the weight. 15+1 rounds. Night sights.

Saved myself from a $1,200 mistake."

That's why we exist.

7 days of living with a gun beats 7 minutes of holding one at the counter.

Rent it Saturday. Decide Sunday.

## Thursday, Feb 20 — Quick Tips / Hacks

**Platform:** Instagram Carousel (5 slides)
**Theme:** "5 things to do during your 7-day rental"

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
"Renting your first gun? Do these 5 things."

**Slide 2:**
"Day 1-2: Break it in"
Put 200+ rounds through it. A gun at round 50 feels different than round 300. Don't judge until it's broken in.

**Slide 3:**
"Day 3-4: Carry it (if applicable)"
Wear it concealed for a full day. How does it feel at the grocery store? In the car? Bending over?

**Slide 4:**
"Day 5-6: Stress test"
Shoot in low light if your range allows. Try rapid fire. Practice reloads. See how it handles when things aren't perfect.

**Slide 5:**
"Day 7: The verdict"
You now have more real-world data than any YouTube reviewer gave you. Keep it or send it back. Your call.

7 days with a rental gun isn't just range time.

It's a test drive.

Here's how to get the most out of your rental week:

1. Break it in (200+ rounds minimum)
2. Carry it daily (if it's a carry gun)
3. Stress test it (low light, rapid fire, reloads)
4. Live with it (weight on your hip, in your nightstand, in your range bag)
5. Decide with real data

Most members try 2-3 guns before buying. That's not indecision. That's smart.
