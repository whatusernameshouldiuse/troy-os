## Monday, Feb 24 — Educational Carousel

**Type:** Instagram Carousel (5 slides) + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Topic:** "5 Guns Every New Shooter Should Rent Before Buying Anything"

### Instagram

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
5 Guns Every New Shooter Should Rent Before Buying Anything

**Slide 2:**
#1 — Glock 19 Gen 5
The "everyone recommends it" gun. You need to know if you're one of them. Some people love the trigger. Others hate the grip angle. Only one way to find out.

**Slide 3:**
#2 — Sig Sauer P365XL
The "fits most hands" carry gun. But "most" isn't "yours." Rent it. Shoot 200 rounds. Then decide if it earned a spot on your hip.

**Slide 4:**
#3 — Smith & Wesson M&P Shield Plus
The "budget king" everyone talks about. But cheap and right aren't the same thing. $400 saved means nothing if it sits in your safe untouched.

**Slide 5:**
#4 — Springfield Hellcat Pro
The "highest capacity micro" pick. 15+1 in a subcompact sounds perfect on paper. Feels different in your hand. Find out for yourself.

**Slide 6:**
#5 — Ruger GP100 (.357 Mag)
The revolver wildcard. Some shooters try a semi-auto and realize they're revolver people. You won't know until you shoot one.

**Slide 7 (CTA):**
Stop researching. Start shooting.
Rent any of these for 7 days.
Your rental fee applies if you buy.
Link in bio.

**Caption:**
You've read 47 Reddit threads. Watched 23 YouTube reviews. Asked your buddy who "knows guns."

And you still don't know which one to buy.

Here's why: specs don't tell you how a gun FEELS in YOUR hands.

These 5 guns cover every major style a new shooter should experience before spending a dime:

1. Glock 19 Gen 5 — The universal recommendation
2. Sig P365XL — The carry gun standard
3. S&W M&P Shield Plus — The budget pick
4. Springfield Hellcat Pro — The capacity king
5. Ruger GP100 — The revolver wildcard

Rent one. Rent all five. The point is: shoot them before you buy.

7 days. Real range time. Zero regret.

## Tuesday, Feb 25 — Inventory Spotlight

**Type:** Instagram Single/Carousel + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Featured Gun:** CZ 75 SP-01
**Why this gun:** Underrated pick that surprises people. Not the typical Glock/Sig recommendation. Shows catalog depth and gives experienced shooters something to notice.

### Instagram

**Slide 1:**
CZ 75 SP-01
The gun your favorite gun YouTuber actually carries.

**Slide 2:**
Specs:
- Caliber: 9mm
- Capacity: 18+1
- Weight: 40.7 oz (steel frame)
- Barrel: 4.6"
- Action: SA/DA

**Slide 3:**
Best For:
- Shooters who want a full-size range/home defense gun
- Anyone tired of polymer frames
- Competition shooters looking for a starter gun
- People who want to know why CZ has a cult following

**Slide 4 (CTA):**
Rent the CZ 75 SP-01 for 7 days.
If you buy it, your rental fee applies.
Link in bio.

**Caption:**
The CZ 75 SP-01.

There's a reason competition shooters, military units, and serious enthusiasts keep coming back to this platform.

Steel frame. All-metal construction. Low bore axis that makes recoil feel like a suggestion.

Most people rent a Glock first. Smart people rent a CZ second.

The weight alone changes how you think about shooting. 40 ounces of "where has this been all my life."

Not for everyone. That's the point. Rent it and find out if you're a CZ person.

7 days. Your range. Your decision.

## Wednesday, Feb 26 — Customer Story / UGC

**Type:** Instagram Feed Post + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Format:** Quote-style testimonial with story context

### Instagram

**Caption:**
"I spent 4 months comparing the Glock 19 and the Sig P320. Read every forum post. Watched every comparison video. Made a spreadsheet.

Then I rented both through Rentagun.

Took the Glock to the range Monday. Took the Sig on Thursday. By Friday I knew.

The Glock was fine. Good gun. But the P320 grip module fit my hand like it was made for me. The trigger was cleaner. The sight picture was faster.

4 months of research. 2 range trips. Done.

Saved myself from ordering the Glock because Reddit said so."
— James K., Tennessee

That's what renting is for.

Not because either gun is bad. Because YOUR hands, YOUR grip, YOUR eyes are the only review that matters.

4 months of tabs open on your phone. Or 2 trips to the range.

Your call.

## Thursday, Feb 27 — Quick Tips

**Type:** Instagram Carousel (6 slides) + Facebook + Twitter/X
**Topic:** "How to Get the Most Out of Your 7-Day Rental"

### Instagram

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
How to Get the Most Out of Your 7-Day Rental
(Don't waste a single range trip)

**Slide 2:**
Day 1-2: First Impressions
Unbox at your FFL. Handle it. Feel the weight. Work the action dry at home (safely, cleared). Notice what jumps out — grip angle, trigger reach, sight picture. Write it down.

**Slide 3:**
Day 3-4: Range Session #1
Bring 100+ rounds. Shoot at 7, 10, and 15 yards. Focus on: recoil management, trigger reset, sight acquisition. Don't try to be accurate yet — just feel the gun.

**Slide 4:**
Day 5: Range Session #2
Now shoot for groups. Try different grips. Shoot weak-hand. Practice draws if you're evaluating for carry. This is where you find out if the gun WORKS for you.

**Slide 5:**
Day 6: Compare Notes
If you've rented before, compare to your last rental. If this is your first, write down: What did I like? What bothered me? Would I carry this every day?

**Slide 6 (CTA):**
Day 7: Decide
Love it? Buy it — your rental fee applies.
Not sure? Return it. Try something else.
That's the whole point.

Link in bio to book your 7-day rental.

**Caption:**
Most people rent a gun and take it to the range once.

That's fine. But you're leaving data on the table.

Here's how to squeeze every bit of value out of your 7-day rental:

Day 1-2: Handle it. Dry fire. Get familiar.
Day 3-4: First range trip — feel, not accuracy.
Day 5: Second range trip — accuracy, carry drills, weak hand.
Day 6: Compare notes. What worked? What didn't?
Day 7: Decide. Buy it or return it.

7 days is enough time to KNOW. But only if you use all 7.

Save this for your next rental.

How to Get the Most Out of Your 7-Day Rental

Most people take a rental gun to the range once. Here's how to actually use all 7 days:

Day 1-2: Handle it at home. Dry fire (safely, cleared). Notice the grip, trigger reach, sight picture.

Day 3-4: First range trip. 100+ rounds. Focus on feel, not accuracy. 7, 10, 15 yards.

Day 5: Second range trip. Now shoot for groups. Try weak-hand. Practice draws if evaluating for carry.

Day 6: Compare notes to previous rentals or your wish list.

Day 7: Decide. Love it? Buy it (rental fee applies). Not sure? Return it. Try something else next.

That's the whole point.
