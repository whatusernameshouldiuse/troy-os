# Rentagun February 2026 Content Calendar

**Theme:** Valentine's Day Experiences & Couples Shooting
**Goal:** Drive gift memberships, couples rentals, "date night at the range" positioning
**Created:** 2026-01-31 (auto-compound)

---

## Monthly Focus

February = **Valentine's Day + "The Gun They Actually Want"**

Key angles:
1. Gift a membership (for significant others who shoot)
2. Couples range days (rent two guns, compare together)
3. "Gift of an experience" (bucket list guns as gifts)
4. Anti-flowers messaging (differentiate from generic gifts)

---

## Week 1: Feb 1-7 (Pre-Valentine's Setup)

### Monday, Feb 3 - Educational
**Platform:** Instagram Carousel
**Topic:** "5 Guns Every Couple Should Try Together"

**Slides:**
1. Cover: "5 Guns Every Couple Should Try Together"
2. Glock 19 - "The reliable one both of you can handle"
3. Sig P365XL - "Compact enough for her, capable enough for him"
4. Ruger Mark IV - "Low recoil, high fun. Perfect warm-up gun"
5. AR-15 - "Because everyone needs to try one"
6. Desert Eagle - "For the couple that doesn't do boring"
7. CTA: "Rent any two. Compare notes at the range."

**Caption:**
```
Valentine's Day is 11 days away.

Skip the flowers. Skip the chocolate. Skip the "experience" that's really just a dinner reservation.

Here are 5 guns every couple should try together:

1. Glock 19 - The "everyone recommends it" gun. See if the hype is real.
2. Sig P365XL - Compact, comfortable, and fits smaller hands.
3. Ruger Mark IV - Low recoil, high smiles. Great starter.
4. AR-15 - Because you've both been curious.
5. Desert Eagle - For the couple that goes all-in.

Rent two. Hit the range. Compare notes.

That's a date.
