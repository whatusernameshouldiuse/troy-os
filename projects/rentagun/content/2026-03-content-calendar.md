# Rentagun March 2026 Content Calendar

**Theme:** Spring Range Season
**Goal:** Transition from winter research to spring action. Drive rentals of long guns, hunting rifles, and outdoor-ready firearms. Position Rentagun as the smart move before hunting season purchases.
**Created:** 2026-02-08 (auto-compound)

## Monthly Focus

March = **Spring Range Season — Stop Researching, Start Shooting**

Key angles:
1. Winter is over — time to hit outdoor ranges
2. Try before you buy your spring/summer gun
3. Hunting prep — turkey season, spring hunts
4. Long guns & rifles spotlight (February was heavy on handguns)
5. "New year, new gun" energy for people who set 2026 shooting goals

## Email Campaigns for March

### Email 1: Mar 3 — Spring Range Season Launch
**Subject:** Winter's over. The range is calling.

```
[First Name],

Quick question: When was the last time you went shooting?

If you have to think about it, it's been too long.

Winter's over. Days are longer. Outdoor ranges are open.

Here's the move for March:

Pick ONE gun you've been researching all winter.
Rent it for 7 days.
Take it to the range while the weather cooperates.

We just added some new long guns to the catalog — rifles, shotguns, lever actions. Not just handguns.

[CTA: See What's New]

Spring range season starts now.

Troy
Rentagun

P.S. Turkey season is around the corner in most states. If you need a shotgun, we've got options.
```

### Email 2: Mar 10 — Hunting Prep
**Subject:** Your elk tag cost enough. Don't gamble on the rifle.

```
[First Name],

Quick math:

Tags, licenses, travel, lodging, gear = $500-$3,000+

Then you're going to grab a rifle you've never field-tested?

That's a gamble. And not the fun kind.

Here's a smarter play:

Rent the exact rifle you're considering.
Shoot 200 rounds at the range.
Test it in the conditions you'll actually hunt in.

THEN decide if it's worth $1,500+.

[CTA: Browse Hunting Rifles]

Your tag money deserves a rifle that's been proven. By you.

Troy

P.S. Most popular hunting rental right now: Remington 700 SPS. Available now.
```

### Email 3: Mar 17 — Lever Action Spotlight
**Subject:** Lever actions are having a moment.

```
[First Name],

Have you noticed? Lever actions are everywhere right now.

Henry. Marlin. Winchester.

YouTube is full of them. Ranges are full of them. And for good reason: they're accurate, reliable, and stupid fun to shoot.

But here's the thing: They feel completely different from a semi-auto.

The action. The weight. The manual cycling. Some people love it. Some people don't.

Only one way to find out.

[CTA: Rent a Lever Action]

Try before you buy. Especially when "buy" costs $800-$1,500.

Troy

P.S. The Henry Big Boy in .357 Mag has been our most-requested lever action. Just saying.
```

---

### Email 4: Mar 24 — Spring Carry Transition
**Subject:** Your winter carry gun won't work in March.

```
[First Name],

Here's a problem you're about to have:

That full-size handgun you've been carrying under a jacket all winter?

It's about to print through every t-shirt you own.

Spring weather = lighter clothes = smaller gun (or a serious holster upgrade).

Before you buy a new carry gun for summer, rent the top 3 contenders:

1. Sig P365 — The gold standard micro
2. Springfield Hellcat — Aggressive grip, good sights
3. S&W Shield Plus — Budget-friendly, 13+1

Rent one. Carry it for a week. Then decide.

[CTA: Rent Your Spring Carry Gun]

Better to find out in 7 days than after you've already bought it.

Troy

P.S. Your rental fee applies if you buy. Zero wasted dollars.
