## Caption

```
"Is renting a gun even legal?"

Yes. Here's how it works:

1. Pick your gun from our catalog (200+ options)
2. We ship it to your local FFL dealer
3. You complete the ATF Form 4473 (same as any gun purchase)
4. Shoot it for 7-30 days
5. Return it with the prepaid label we send you

That's it.

Every transfer goes through a licensed FFL dealer. Every rental is ATF-compliant. No gray areas.

Why rent first?
Because buying blind is how you end up with a $900 handgun that doesn't fit your hand.

Stop researching. Start shooting.

## Facebook Version

**Same carousel concept, adapted caption:**

```
"Wait, you can RENT guns?"

Yes. And yes, it's legal. Here's exactly how it works:

STEP 1: Browse our catalog (200+ firearms) and pick your rental period (7-30 days).

STEP 2: We ship to your local FFL dealer. You complete the same ATF Form 4473 you would for any gun purchase. Background check included.

STEP 3: Shoot it. Take it to the range. Put rounds through it. Live with it for a week or a month.

STEP 4: Return it with the prepaid shipping label we include. Or keep it - your rental fee applies to purchase.

That's the whole process. Every transfer goes through a licensed FFL. 100% ATF-compliant.

No more buying blind. No more YouTube reviews that don't tell you how it feels in YOUR hands.

Try before you buy. It's common sense.
