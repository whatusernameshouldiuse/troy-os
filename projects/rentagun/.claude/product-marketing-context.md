# Product Marketing Context — Rentagun

*Last updated: 2026-02-23*

## Product Overview
**One-liner:** Try any gun before you buy it — nationwide, shipped to your door.
**What it does:** Rentagun is the first national try-before-you-buy firearm rental subscription service. Members rent from 216+ firearms, shipped directly to their local FFL, try it at the range, and decide if they want to buy — without risking hundreds on a gun they might hate.
**Product category:** Firearm rental / try-before-you-buy (how customers search: "rent a gun", "try before you buy gun", "gun rental service", "rent a firearm")
**Product type:** Subscription service + e-commerce
**Business model:** Basic $99/mo (1 rental/month, 7 days, max $1K MSRP) · Pro $199/mo (2 rentals/month, 7 days each, max $3K MSRP)

## Target Audience
**Primary users:** Gun buyers who want to make smarter purchase decisions
**Geography:** US only, excludes CA + 12 other restrictive states
**Age requirement:** 21+ (federal requirement)
**Jobs to be done:**
- "Let me try this gun before dropping $800 on it"
- "I want a special experience — shoot a Thompson at a bachelor party"
- "I need a specific rifle for elk season but don't want to own it year-round"
- "I'm new to guns and have no idea what to buy"

**ICPs:**
1. **The Considerer:** Has narrowed it to 2-3 guns, wants to shoot them before committing. Analytical, research-driven. Decision-frozen.
2. **The Experience Seeker:** Bachelor party, birthday, bucket list. Wants to shoot something cool they'd never own. Emotional, gift-motivated.
3. **The Hunter:** Needs a specialty rifle (precision long-range, suppressed, dangerous game) for a specific trip. Doesn't want to own a $3K gun forever.
4. **The New Gun Owner:** Just got their carry permit. Overwhelmed by options. Doesn't want to make an expensive mistake.

## Problems & Pain Points
**Core problem:** Buying a gun is a $500-$2,000 commitment based on YouTube reviews and range trips with someone else's gun in an uncomfortable range setting — not a real-world test.
**Why alternatives fall short:**
- Range rentals: Limited 15-minute test at the range, can't take it anywhere, poor selection
- YouTube reviews: Someone else's opinion, can't replicate feel/fit for YOUR hands/body
- Asking at a gun store: Salesperson wants to close, not help you find the right fit
- Buying and reselling: Lose $100-300+ on depreciation and transfer fees
**What it costs them:** $600-1,500 spent on a gun that sits in the safe because it doesn't fit. Gun owners waste an estimated $500+ on regretted purchases.
**Emotional tension:** "What if I spend all this money and hate it?" Decision paralysis. The fear is real — guns don't fit everyone the same way.

## Competitive Landscape
**Direct:** Local range rentals (15 min, limited selection, not take-home), no national competitor exists
**Secondary:** Buy → shoot → resell (painful, expensive process)
**Indirect:** Just picking one and hoping (most common — inertia wins)
**How each falls short:** None let you live with a gun for 7 days, take it to multiple ranges, try it in real conditions, and return it if it's wrong.

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- Only national try-before-you-buy service (first mover, no direct competitor)
- 7-day rental = real-world test, not a 15-minute range session
- 216+ firearms including rare/exotic options (Thompson, suppressed rifles, etc.)
- Ships to your FFL — you're not stuck with your local range's selection
- Decision-free return: don't love it, send it back with zero guilt
**Why customers choose Rentagun:** "I can try it FOR REAL. Seven days. My ranges, my ammo, my conditions. Not 15 minutes at the counter."

## Objections
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Is this legal?" | Yes — ships via FFL, standard background check, fully federally compliant. Same process as buying. |
| "What if it gets damaged?" | Covered under the rental terms — normal wear is expected. You're not buying, you're trying. |
| "$99/month seems expensive" | One regretted gun purchase costs $600+ and depreciation. One rental that prevents that is an ROI. |
| "Can I just rent at my local range?" | Range rentals are 15 minutes with the salesman watching. This is 7 days at your range, your pace. |
| "What states don't you ship to?" | CA, and 12 other restrictive states. Check the map at rentagun.com. |

**Anti-persona:** Someone who already knows exactly what gun they want and is ready to buy. Not the right moment — they don't need to try first.

## Switching Dynamics
**Push:** Just made a bad gun purchase and lost money reselling; paralysis from too many options
**Pull:** 7-day real-world trial with any of 216 guns, no commitment
**Habit:** "Range rentals are good enough" / "I'll just pick one and see"
**Anxiety:** "Is shipping a gun really safe/legal?" — addressed by FFL process transparency

## Customer Language
**How they describe the problem:**
- "I've been going back and forth between these two guns for months"
- "I bought one and it just didn't feel right"
- "I wish I could have tried it first"
- "My hands are different, reviews don't really tell me how it'll feel for ME"
**How they describe Rentagun:**
- "Netflix for guns" (we don't use this but they say it)
- "Try before you buy"
- "Like renting a car before buying"
**Words to use:** try, test, decide, confident, 7 days, real conditions, no commitment, return
**Words to avoid:** "Netflix of guns" (too casual, potential brand confusion)

## Brand Voice
**Tone:** Straight-shooter, honest, no BS, fun. Your buddy who's been to every range and doesn't judge.
**Style:** Direct, conversational, short sentences. Zero pretension.
**Personality:** Anti-establishment (vs. gun store pushy sales culture), community-first, confident

## Proof Points
**Differentiator:** First and only national service
**Inventory:** 216+ firearms
**Selection breadth:** Exotic/rare options (Thompson, suppressed, precision long-range)
**Taglines that work:** "Rent it Saturday. Decide Sunday." / "Try before you buy." / "Stop researching. Start shooting."

## Goals
**Business goal:** Grow monthly subscribers (Basic + Pro)
**Primary conversion action:** Start subscription / first rental booking
**Secondary conversion:** OI.io affiliate referrals from creators
**Current metrics:** Active post-SHOT Show 2026 — scaling from initial subscriber base
