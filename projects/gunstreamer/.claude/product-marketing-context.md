# Product Marketing Context — GunStreamer

*Last updated: 2026-02-23*

## Product Overview
**One-liner:** The only live commerce platform built specifically for licensed firearms dealers.
**What it does:** GunStreamer is a live streaming platform where licensed FFL dealers sell firearms and accessories in real-time, on camera — buyers can watch the gun cycle, ask questions, and bid live. Solves the trust problem that makes online gun buying feel like a gamble.
**Product category:** Live commerce / firearms marketplace (how buyers search: "buy guns online", "live gun auction", "watch gun deals live"; how FFLs search: "sell guns online", "gun live stream", "online gun auction platform")
**Product type:** SaaS platform + marketplace
**Business model:** SaaS for FFLs + 3% transaction fee on all live sales. Fed by BBGV consignment inventory as anchor supply.

## Target Audience

### Buyer Side (CURRENT PRIORITY — need more buyers than FFLs right now)
**Who:** Online gun buyers who've been burned by or are afraid of GunBroker/Armslist listings
**Decision-makers:** Individual buyers, 25-55, predominantly male, active gun purchasers
**Primary use case:** Buy a gun they can actually SEE and verify before paying
**Jobs to be done:**
- "Let me see this gun work before I wire money to a stranger"
- "I want to buy guns without worrying about condition misrepresentation"
- "Find deals on guns from verified dealers, not sketchy private sellers"

### FFL/Seller Side
**Who:** Licensed FFL dealers, 1-10 person shops, $500K-$5M revenue, want to sell online but don't have e-commerce infrastructure
**Primary use case:** Sell existing inventory to a national buyer audience without building their own online store
**Jobs to be done:** "Move inventory faster, reach buyers outside my local market"

## Problems & Pain Points

### Buyer's Problem
**Core problem:** Online gun buying is trust-blind. Photos lie. "Good condition" means different things to everyone. Sellers can misrepresent, disappear after payment, or ship something totally different from what was listed.
**Why alternatives fall short:**
- GunBroker: Photos only, seller description is the only info, no accountability for condition misrepresentation
- Armslist: Even less accountability, scam-prone, no verification
- Facebook Marketplace: Firearms restricted, no FFL guarantee
- Local gun shops: Limited selection, in-person only
**What it costs them:** Receiving a gun that's not as described. Transfer fees wasted. Reshipment hassle. No recourse.
**Emotional tension:** "I want to buy online for selection and price, but I'm afraid of getting scammed."

### FFL's Problem
**Core problem:** Local market limits how fast inventory moves. No easy way to reach national buyers. Building an online presence requires tech skills most FFLs don't have.

## Competitive Landscape
**Direct:** GunBroker (static listings, no live), Armslist (private sales, no accountability)
**Secondary:** Whatnot, eBay Live (can't do firearms), local gun show circuit
**Indirect:** Just buying locally (inertia, limited selection)
**How each falls short:** None offer live camera verification, real-time Q&A, and FFL-backed transaction trust in one package.

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- LIVE camera = buyer can see condition, function, and ask questions in real time
- FFL-only sellers = every seller is federally licensed and accountable
- BBGV valuation backing = price context from 45 years of market data
- Legal compliance built in = no workarounds, no grey areas
- Category exclusive = no mainstream platform will ever allow this content
**Why buyers choose GunStreamer:** "I can watch the FFL rack the slide, check the bore, answer my questions live — THEN I buy."

## Objections
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "How is this different from GunBroker?" | GunBroker is photos and a description. GunStreamer is live video — you watch the gun function before you bid. |
| "Is this legal?" | 100% legal. All sellers are licensed FFLs. All transfers go through standard FFL process with background check. |
| "What if I can't watch live?" | Replays available. Set alerts for guns you're watching. |
| "I don't know these sellers" | Every seller is a federally licensed FFL — they're regulated, background-checked, and accountable. |

**Anti-persona:** Private party sellers (platform is FFL-only). Buyers who only want in-person. Non-US buyers.

## Switching Dynamics
**Push (buyers):** Got burned on a GunBroker purchase; tired of condition misrepresentation
**Pull (buyers):** See the gun LIVE before buying — zero ambiguity on condition
**Habit:** "I just use GunBroker, it's what everyone uses"
**Anxiety (buyers):** "Is live auction pricing higher than fixed-price listings?" — addressed by showing competitive pricing

## Customer Language
**How buyers describe the problem:**
- "I've been burned before buying guns online"
- "Pictures don't tell you everything"
- "I want to see it work before I buy it"
- "GunBroker descriptions are useless"
**How they'd describe GunStreamer:**
- "Like watching a gun show from your couch"
- "The only place I can actually SEE what I'm buying"
**Words to use:** live, verified, watch, see, FFL, trusted, real-time, transparent
**Words to avoid:** auction (creates price-gouging anxiety if used wrongly), guaranteed (too strong)

## Brand Voice
**Tone:** Straight-talking, pro-2A, community-first. Not corporate. Not tacti-cool.
**Style:** Direct. Trust-building through transparency, not hype.
**Personality:** The honest gun dealer who shows you everything and hides nothing

## Proof Points
**Category creation:** First live commerce platform built for firearms
**Legal credibility:** FFL-only sellers, full transfer compliance
**Ecosystem backing:** Built on BBGV's 45-year valuation authority

## Goals
**Business goal (current phase):** Build buyer audience BEFORE FFL onboarding push
**Primary conversion action:** Buyer email list / waitlist signup
**Secondary:** FFL creator onboarding (through OI.io pipeline)
**Status:** Pre-launch — marketing content only, no development work currently
