# GunStreamer — Project Operating Instructions

## Before Any Marketing Task

1. **Read context first:** Load `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — this has ICPs, brand voice, competitive landscape, customer language, objections, and proof points. Do not ask for information already covered there.

2. **Pick the right skill:** Check `~/clawd/skills/` for the applicable skill. Use it.
   - Writing copy → `copywriting` or `copywriter`
   - Launch strategy → `launch-strategy`
   - Content ideas → `content-strategy` or `marketing-ideas`
   - Social content → `social-content`
   - Ads → `ad-creative` or `paid-ads`
   - Email sequences → `email-sequence`
   - Landing page → `page-cro` or `copywriting`

3. **Execute to draft-ready status.** Don't stop at outlines. Write the actual copy, full email, complete landing page. Troy reviews, not rewrites.

4. **Output to Obsidian:** Write directly to `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/GunStreamer/` and open immediately:
   `open "obsidian://open?vault=Work&file=Projects%2FGunStreamer%2F<filename>"`

## Project Context

- **Website:** gunstreamer.com
- **Status:** PRE-LAUNCH — marketing content only. Zero development work.
- **Current priority:** Build BUYER audience before FFL push
- **Marketing model:** Viral Operator (one big announcement, engineered launch)
- **Ecosystem feed:** BBGV consignment inventory as anchor supply; OI.io as creator pipeline
- **Obsidian path:** `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/GunStreamer/`

## Brand Rules

- Trust is the entire value proposition — every piece of content should build it
- Positioning: "See it live before you buy it" — not "auction platform"
- FFL-only sellers = accountability angle, lean into this
- BBGV backing = 45-year authority, use as credibility anchor
- NO development promises — platform isn't built yet, don't over-promise features
- Target buyers first in all content; FFLs are secondary at this stage
