## 1. Twitter Strategy (Primary Launch Channel)

### Launch Thread Templates

#### Launch Thread #1: The Problem/Solution
```
The online gun market has a trust problem.

Grainy photos. Vague descriptions. "I swear it works."

Result? Buyers overpay or get burned. FFLs struggle to stand out.

There's a better way. 🧵

[1/8]

---

Every day, serious buyers scroll GunBroker hoping that ONE photo tells the truth.

Every day, reputable FFLs lose sales to whoever has the best product photography.

This isn't how high-value transactions should work.

[2/8]

---

What if buyers could watch a gun being handled, cycled, and demonstrated—live—before they bid?

What if they could ask questions in real-time?

What if trust was built through transparency, not guesswork?

That's @GunStreamer.

[3/8]

---

Here's how it works:

Licensed FFLs stream their inventory live.
Buyers watch, ask questions, see every detail.
Purchase happens live, on camera.
Ships to buyer's local FFL. Legal. Transparent. Smart.

[4/8]

---

For FFLs:
→ Reach buyers nationwide
→ Demonstrate quality in real-time
→ Build reputation through live interaction
→ 3% transaction fee (vs GunBroker's 6%+)

For Buyers:
→ See the gun before you bid
→ Ask questions directly
→ Watch it cycle, see every scratch
→ Buy with confidence

[5/8]

---

We're in SOFT LAUNCH right now.

Early FFLs are going live.
Buyers are watching.
Sales are happening.

This is what the future of gun buying looks like.

If you're a buyer tired of grainy photos:
→ Join waitlist at gunstreamer.com

We're building this WITH the community, not AT it.

The trust problem in online gun sales isn't going away.

But the solution is here.

Welcome to @GunStreamer.

#### Launch Thread #2: The FFL Opportunity
```
FFLs: Your inventory is sitting on a shelf.

Your best customers? They're 500 miles away and don't know you exist.

GunBroker charges 6%+ and you're competing on photos alone.

There's a better way to sell. 🧵

[1/7]

---

Imagine this:

You go live on Thursday night.
50 buyers watching.
You pick up a Colt Python, show the action, answer questions.
"What's that finish wear on the grip?" — you zoom in, show it.

3 bids. Sold in 8 minutes. No grainy photos. No guessing.

[2/7]

---

That's @GunStreamer.

Live commerce for firearms. Built FOR FFLs.

→ Stream your inventory live
→ Demonstrate quality in real-time
→ Answer buyer questions on camera
→ Build your reputation stream by stream

[3/7]

---

Why FFLs are switching:

✅ 3% transaction fee (vs GunBroker 6%+)
✅ Nationwide reach from your shop
✅ No photography setup needed
✅ Buyers see quality = fewer returns
✅ Build loyal following across the country

[4/7]

---

Early FFLs are already seeing results:

"First stream, 4 guns sold. Buyers loved seeing them live."
— Kentucky FFL, Week 1

"I answer questions on camera. No more 'is this scratch big?' emails."
— Texas FFL, Week 2

[5/7]

---

We're in SOFT LAUNCH.

Looking for 20 more FFLs who want to build with us.

→ Must be licensed FFL
→ Ready to stream 1-2x/week
→ Willing to give feedback as we grow

Apply: gunstreamer.com/ffl

[6/7]

Your inventory is valuable.
Your expertise is valuable.
Your reputation should travel nationwide.

Let's make it happen.

P.S. - FFLs, what's your biggest challenge selling online right now? 👇
```

#### Launch Thread #3: Buyer Trust Story
```
Real story:

Guy buys a "$1,200 mint condition" 1911 on GunBroker.

Gets it. Finish is worn. Barrel has pitting. "Mint."

Calls seller. "Photos looked fine to me."

He's out shipping both ways + transfer fees.

This happens EVERY DAY. 🧵

[1/6]

---

The online gun market has a massive trust gap.

Sellers post 2 grainy photos and a vague description.
Buyers squint, zoom, guess, hope.
$1,500 changes hands.
Fingers crossed.

There's zero reason this should still be how we buy guns in 2026.

[2/6]

---

What if you could watch the seller handle the gun, live?

See the finish in natural light.
Watch them cycle the action.
Ask "what's that mark near the ejection port?"
Zoom in. See for yourself.

Then decide.

That's @GunStreamer.

[3/6]

---

How it works:

→ Licensed FFLs stream their inventory live
→ You watch, ask questions, see every detail
→ Purchase live on stream
→ Ships to YOUR local FFL
→ Legal, transparent, smart

No more guessing. No more "mint condition" surprises.

[4/6]

---

Early buyers are saying:

"Finally! I saw the holster wear BEFORE I bid."
"Asked about the trigger pull, he showed me. Bought it."
"This is how gun buying should work."

[5/6]

We're in soft launch. Building the waitlist.

```
Hey [Name],

Saw you're [specific observation about their business/post].

Quick question: ever frustrated that your best inventory sits on the shelf while buyers 500 miles away would snap it up?

We're building live commerce for FFLs—think Whatnot, but for guns. Licensed FFLs stream inventory, buyers watch live and purchase.

In soft launch now. Looking for [10] more FFLs to build with us.

3% transaction fee. Nationwide reach. No photo studio needed.

Worth a 10-min call? I can show you exactly how it works.

```

#### Email to FFLs (If you have their email)
**Subject:** Your inventory deserves nationwide reach

```
[First Name],

You've got [X] guns in inventory right now that someone in [different state] would buy today.

But they don't know you exist.

And GunBroker? You're competing on grainy photos. 6%+ fees. Zero differentiation.

Here's a better way:

GunStreamer is live commerce for firearms. You stream your inventory live (like Whatnot), buyers watch in real-time, ask questions, see every detail—then purchase.

Early FFLs are seeing results:
→ 4-8 guns sold per stream
→ Buyers from 3-5 states per session
→ 3% transaction fee (vs GunBroker 6%+)
→ Building national reputation stream by stream

We're in soft launch. Looking for [X] more FFLs who want early access.

Worth a quick demo? I'll show you exactly how it works—no pitch, just the platform.

Book 15 min: [calendly link]
Or reply with a good time to call.

Best,
[Your Name]
GunStreamer Team

P.S. - You keep your FFL license, your shop, your way of doing business. We just give you the stage to reach buyers nationwide.
```

#### Follow-Up Sequence (If No Response)

**Day 3:**
```
[First Name],

Following up on my note about GunStreamer.

Quick question: if you could stream your inventory to 500+ buyers nationwide this Thursday—no photo setup, no shipping until it's sold—would that interest you?

That's what we're building. FFLs in [nearby state] are already going live.

Let me know if you want a 10-min demo.

- [Your Name]
```

**Day 7:**
```
[First Name],

Last one from me—didn't want you to miss this.

GunStreamer soft launch is closing in [X] days. After that, new FFLs join the waitlist.

If nationwide reach + live selling + 3% fees sounds interesting, let's talk this week.

Reply with "DEMO" and I'll send you a link.

Otherwise, I'll catch you at full launch.

**Example (Filled In):**

---

#### Blue Ridge Firearms: 23 Guns Sold in First Month

**Location:** Asheville, NC
**Specialization:** Vintage military surplus & collector rifles
**Challenge:** Local market too small, GunBroker fees eating margins

**The Problem:**
"I've got $40K in vintage rifles sitting here. Local buyers? Maybe 3 people in 100 miles who care about a Finnish M39 Mosin. GunBroker works, but 6% fees plus I'm competing against whoever took the best photos that day. I know my inventory better than anyone—I just couldn't show it."

— Mike T., Blue Ridge Firearms

**The GunStreamer Solution:**
Mike joined our soft launch in December. He streams Tuesday and Thursday nights at 7pm EST, focusing on his military surplus collection.

**Results After 4 Weeks:**
- **23 guns sold** (avg 5.75 per stream)
- **Buyers from 11 states** (vs 90% local before)
- **Average 78 viewers** per stream
- **$18,400 in sales** first month

**What Changed:**
> "First stream, I picked up a Yugoslav M48 Mauser. Showed the crest, the bore, the stock stampings. Guy in Oregon said 'I've been looking for that exact crest for 6 months.' Sold in 4 minutes. That NEVER happens on GunBroker. The buyers who care can finally see what they're getting."

**Key Insight:**
Mike goes deep on history during his streams. He doesn't just show the gun—he tells the story. His viewers aren't just buying; they're learning. That builds loyalty.

## 3. Buyer Marketing (Building Waitlist)

### Trust-Building Content

**Content Series: "The Online Gun Buying Problem"**

**Post 1: The Scam Story**
```
Title: I Paid $1,200 for a "Mint" 1911. Here's What Showed Up.

[Twitter thread or blog post]

The photos looked great. Two angles. "Mint condition" in the title.

I bought it.

3 weeks later (shipping + FFL transfer), I'm holding a gun with:
→ Finish wear on the slide
→ Pitting in the barrel
→ Grips clearly replaced (not original)

"Mint."

I call the seller. "Looked fine to me in the photos."

I'm out:
→ $1,200 purchase
→ $45 shipping to my FFL
→ $35 transfer fee
→ $45 shipping back
→ $35 return transfer

$1,360 to learn "mint" means nothing when all you have is 2 photos.

This happens every day.

GunBroker, Armslist, forums—doesn't matter. Same problem.

BUYERS CAN'T SEE WHAT THEY'RE BUYING.

What if you could watch the seller handle the gun, live?
Ask questions. See every scratch. Watch it cycle.

Then decide.

That's GunStreamer. Join the waitlist: gunstreamer.com
```

**Post 2: The Trust Gap**
```
Title: Why Gun Buyers Overpay (And How to Fix It)

When you can't see quality, you pay for uncertainty.

That "$800" Glock on GunBroker? You bid $900 because you're scared someone else sees something you don't.

That "excellent condition" 1911? You lowball to $600 because you assume it's worse than described.

Both buyers lose.

The REAL cost of grainy photos:
→ Buyers overpay out of fear
→ Buyers underbid out of distrust
→ Good sellers can't prove quality
→ Bad sellers hide defects

Everyone loses except the scammers.

GunStreamer fixes this. Watch the gun live. See the quality. Bid accordingly.

Fair prices. Transparent sales. Trust earned.

Join waitlist: gunstreamer.com

**Post 3: The Vision**

Title: What Gun Buying Should Look Like in 2026

It's Thursday night.

You open GunStreamer. Browse FFLs by state.

A shop in Montana goes live. The owner picks up a Winchester 1873 you've been hunting for.

You watch him:
→ Work the lever action
→ Show the bore with a borescope
→ Point out the finish wear ("right here, see?")
→ Answer your question about the stock repair

You see everything. No guessing. No grainy photos.

7 minutes later, it's yours. Ships to your local FFL.

That's not the future. That's GunStreamer. Coming soon.

**Email 2: Behind the Scenes (Day 3)**

```
Subject: First stream went LIVE last night

[First Name],

Wanted to share this with you.

Last night, [FFL Name] in [State] went live on GunStreamer for the first time.

On the table:
→ 8 guns
→ 47 viewers watching
→ 4 sold in 35 minutes

One buyer (from 600 miles away) said:

"I've been looking at photos of Colt Pythons for 3 months. Watching you handle it live for 90 seconds told me more than 100 GunBroker listings."

Sold 2 minutes later.

This is what we're building. Transparency > guessing.

More FFLs going live every week. You'll be first to know when [State] joins.

Stay tuned.

- [Your Name]
```

**Email 3: "The Problem" Content (Day 7)**

```
Subject: Why gun buyers overpay (and how to fix it)

[First Name],

Quick story:

A buyer paid $1,200 for a "mint condition" 1911 on GunBroker.

2 photos. Glowing description. "Mint."

It arrived:
→ Finish wear on the slide
→ Barrel pitting
→ Grips replaced (not original)

He's out $1,200 + $125 in fees and shipping.

The seller? "Looked mint to me in the photos."

This happens EVERY. DAY.

The problem isn't bad sellers (mostly). It's that grainy photos can't show quality.

So buyers:
→ Overpay out of fear (scared they're missing something)
→ Underbid out of distrust (assume it's worse than described)

Both buyers lose.

GunStreamer fixes this. Watch the gun live. See every detail. Buy with confidence.

We're getting close. You'll be first to know when we launch in [State].

- [Your Name]

P.S. - Ever been burned by a "mint condition" gun? Reply and tell me. I'm collecting these stories.
```

**Email 4: Social Proof (Day 14)**

```
Subject: "This is how gun buying should work"

[First Name],

Early buyers are saying things like this:

"Finally! I saw the holster wear BEFORE I bid."
"Asked about the trigger pull. He showed me live. No more guessing."
"Bought a Python last week. Watched him demo it for 5 minutes. Exactly as described when it arrived."

This is the feedback we're getting during soft launch.

Buyers WANT transparency.
FFLs WANT to show quality.
GunStreamer makes it happen.

We're at [X] FFLs live. [Y] guns sold. [Z] buyers watching.

You're on the list. You'll be first to access when [State] launches.

Almost there.

## 5. Social Proof Strategy

### How to Collect and Display Proof

**Collection Strategy (During Soft Launch):**

**1. After Every Stream:**
Send automated email to FFL within 1 hour:
```
Subject: How'd tonight's stream go?

Hey [FFL Name],

Great stream tonight! [X] viewers, [Y] guns sold.

Quick question: would you be willing to share a sentence about your experience? We're collecting feedback for other FFLs considering the platform.

Just reply to this email with:
- What surprised you most
- Would you recommend GunStreamer to other FFLs?

Thanks!
```

**2. After Buyer Purchase:**
Send email 3 days after gun arrives at their FFL:
```
Subject: How was your GunStreamer purchase?

Hey [Buyer Name],

Your [Gun Name] should have arrived at your FFL by now.

Quick question: how was the experience?

Did the gun match what you saw on stream?
Would you buy from GunStreamer again?

Just reply with a sentence or two—we're building social proof for buyers considering the platform.

Thanks!
```

**3. Make It EASY:**
- Don't ask for long-form testimonials (yet)
- One sentence is perfect
- Offer to write it for them: "Does this sound right: '[Draft testimonial]'?"
- Incentivize: "Reply with feedback, get entered to win [X]"

### FFL Success Stories (Case Study Format)

**See "Case Study Format" section above**

**Where to Display:**
- Landing page (dedicated "Success Stories" section)
- Twitter (thread format, every Monday)
- Email to prospects (FFL outreach)

### Buyer Testimonials

**Where to Collect:**
- Post-purchase email (3 days after delivery)
- Twitter mentions (RT and screenshot)
- Chat during streams (ask permission to quote)
- Follow-up email 30 days later ("How's the gun?")

**What to Ask For:**
- "Did the gun match what you saw on stream?"
- "How does this compare to buying on GunBroker?"
- "Would you buy from GunStreamer again?"

**Where to Display:**
- Landing page (quotes with first name + state)
- Twitter (quote cards with testimonial text)
- Email to waitlist (social proof in updates)
- FFL pitch deck (show FFLs that buyers love the platform)

**Testimonial Card Template (for Twitter/Landing Page):**
```
"[Testimonial text in quotes]"

— [First Name L.], [State]
[Type of gun purchased]
```

**Example:**
```
"Watched him work the action live for 2 minutes. Asked about the bore. He showed me with a borescope. Exactly as described when it arrived. This is how gun buying should work."

— Mark T., Texas
Colt Python (.357 Magnum)
```
