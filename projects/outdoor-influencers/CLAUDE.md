# OutdoorInfluencers.io — Project Operating Instructions

## Before Any Marketing Task

1. **Read context first:** Load `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — this has ICPs (creator segments + brand side), brand voice, competitive landscape, customer language, objections. Do not ask for information already covered there.

2. **Pick the right skill:** Check `~/clawd/skills/` for the applicable skill. Use it.
   - Writing copy → `copywriting` or `copywriter`
   - Email sequences → `email-sequence`
   - Launch strategy → `launch-strategy`
   - Referral/affiliate → `referral-program`
   - Content ideas → `content-strategy` or `marketing-ideas`
   - Social content → `social-content`
   - CRO → `page-cro` or `signup-flow-cro`
   - Cold outreach to creators/brands → `cold-email`
   - Ads → `ad-creative` or `paid-ads`

3. **Execute to draft-ready status.** Don't stop at outlines. Write the actual copy, full email, complete landing page. Troy reviews, not rewrites.

4. **Output to Obsidian:** Write directly to the iCloud vault path for this project and open immediately:
   `open "obsidian://open?vault=Work&file=Projects%2FOutdoor%20Influencers%2F<filename>"`
   **Note:** This project's vault is at `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Work/Projects/Outdoor Influencers/`

## Project Context

- **Website:** outdoorinfluencers.io (pre-launch)
- **Status:** Phase 1 Foundation — landing page HTML ready, email sequence written, campaign briefs complete
- **Revenue focus:** Creator subscriptions (Pro/Mastermind) + brand campaign fees + 10-15% transaction fee
- **Anchor brands:** BBGV, Rentagun, GunStreamer (immediate earnings for sprint creators)
- **$500-in-14-days sprint:** Stacked flat fees (BBGV $500 + Rentagun $300 + GunStreamer $200) = $1,000+ conservative
- **Email tool:** ConvertKit (decision pending — may migrate to Klaviyo)
- **Marketing model:** Content Machine (creator-side) + Viral Operator (brand/launch side)
- **Obsidian path:** `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Work/Projects/Outdoor Influencers/`

## Brand Rules

- Voice: Straight-talking, community-first, anti-establishment vs. corporate marketing world
- Lead with earnings — creators care about money first
- Be specific: "$25 per booking" not "competitive commissions"
- NO guru/course language — this is a marketplace, not a course
- Address the platform suppression reality honestly — it's their biggest pain
- Email 4 proof data is PLACEHOLDER until Sprint Cohort 1 produces real numbers — do not use fabricated earnings as real proof

## Critical Flags

- GunStreamer is PRE-LAUNCH — frame as "beta access" not guaranteed live sales income. Sprint = Rentagun ($300) + GunStreamer ($200 beta). BBGV removed from sprint structure.
- Email 4 ([Creator A] $520 etc.) must be updated with real data before sending — currently placeholder
- Sprint promise is $500 (Rentagun $300 + GunStreamer $200), NOT $1,000. Update sprint copy accordingly.

## Skills Pipeline — Chain of Inputs

**BEFORE running any skill, read these in order:**

1. `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — base context (ICP, brand voice, ecosystem)
2. `_pipeline/pipeline-manifest.md` — ALL prior key decisions, in dependency order
3. `_pipeline/skill-inputs/<this-skill>-inputs.md` — if it exists, read it before touching a file

**Skills build on previous outputs. Never run a skill cold.**

The pipeline exists at:
`~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Work/Projects/Outdoor Influencers/_pipeline/`

### Skill Input Templates Location
Each queued skill has a pre-built input template listing exactly which files to read and which decisions to apply. Use them.

### Key Pipeline Rules
- **Identity language:** Creators are "outdoor creators" or "hunting/fishing/shooting creators" — never "influencers" in creator-facing copy
- **Pricing:** Pro $49/mo | Mastermind $149/mo | Transaction fees: Free 15% / Pro 10% / Mastermind 5%
- **Sprint:** Rentagun ($300) + GunStreamer ($200 beta) = $500 total. BBGV removed from sprint.
- **Anchoring:** Always lead with total before parts. "$500" → then explain the stack.
- **Psychology rule:** Pain opens. Aspiration closes. Never reverse.
- **1 CTA per email. Always.**
- **Social proof specificity:** Include follower count, niche, dollar amount, time frame. Never round numbers.
