# OutdoorInfluencers.io — Project Operating Instructions

## Before Any Marketing Task

1. **Read context first:** Load `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — this has ICPs (creator segments + brand side), brand voice, competitive landscape, customer language, objections. Do not ask for information already covered there.

2. **Pick the right skill:** Check `~/clawd/skills/` for the applicable skill. Use it.
   - Writing copy → `copywriting` or `copywriter`
   - Email sequences → `email-sequence`
   - Launch strategy → `launch-strategy`
   - Referral/affiliate → `referral-program`
   - Content ideas → `content-strategy` or `marketing-ideas`
   - Social content → `social-content`
   - CRO → `page-cro` or `signup-flow-cro`
   - Cold outreach to creators/brands → `cold-email`
   - Ads → `ad-creative` or `paid-ads`

3. **Execute to draft-ready status.** Don't stop at outlines. Write the actual copy, full email, complete landing page. Troy reviews, not rewrites.

4. **Output to Obsidian:** Write directly to the iCloud vault path for this project and open immediately:
   `open "obsidian://open?vault=Work&file=Projects%2FOutdoor%20Influencers%2F<filename>"`
   **Note:** This project's vault is at `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Work/Projects/Outdoor Influencers/`

## Project Context

- **Website:** outdoorinfluencers.io (pre-launch)
- **Status:** Phase 1 Foundation — landing page HTML ready, email sequence written, campaign briefs complete
- **Revenue focus:** Creator subscriptions (Pro/Mastermind) + brand campaign fees + 10-15% transaction fee
- **Anchor brands:** BBGV, Rentagun, GunStreamer (immediate earnings for sprint creators)
- **$500-in-14-days sprint:** Stacked flat fees (BBGV $500 + Rentagun $300 + GunStreamer $200) = $1,000+ conservative
- **Email tool:** ConvertKit (decision pending — may migrate to Klaviyo)
- **Marketing model:** Content Machine (creator-side) + Viral Operator (brand/launch side)
- **Obsidian path:** `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Work/Projects/Outdoor Influencers/`

## Brand Rules

- Voice: Straight-talking, community-first, anti-establishment vs. corporate marketing world
- Lead with earnings — creators care about money first
- Be specific: "$25 per booking" not "competitive commissions"
- NO guru/course language — this is a marketplace, not a course
- Address the platform suppression reality honestly — it's their biggest pain
- Email 4 proof data is PLACEHOLDER until Sprint Cohort 1 produces real numbers — do not use fabricated earnings as real proof

## Critical Flags

- GunStreamer is PRE-LAUNCH — do NOT promise sprint creators they can earn from GunStreamer streaming in 14 days until platform is live. Use BBGV + Rentagun for Sprint Cohort 1 only.
- Email 4 ([Creator A] $520 etc.) must be updated with real data before sending — currently placeholder
