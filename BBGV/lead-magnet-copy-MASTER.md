## SUBHEADLINE
*(Use with all three headline variants)*

The Blue Book of Gun Values has been the trusted pricing standard for dealers, collectors, and buyers since 1981. Now that data is free — for everyone.

Enter any firearm and get an instant valuation based on real market transactions, not what someone *hopes* to get on Armslist.

---

## VALUE PROPOSITION BULLETS

### For Buyers:
- **Know before you offer.** See the fair market range for any make, model, and condition — so you never overpay at a gun show or private sale.
- **"Is this price fair?" answered honestly.** We'll tell you if a listing is high, low, or right in the ballpark — without the dealer spin.
- **180,000+ models in the database.** From a 1960s Winchester Model 70 to last year's SIG P365 — if it's been sold, we've tracked it.
- **Updated continuously.** Not last year's prices. Not MSRP. What guns are actually trading for, right now.

### For Sellers:
- **Know what you actually have before you sell.** Most sellers leave money on the table because they don't check the data first.
- **Compare every option — dealer trade-in, private sale, consignment.** One valuation, multiple paths. You decide what fits.
- **No pressure, no obligation.** This is information, not a sales pitch. Look up your gun and do nothing, or act on it — completely up to you.
- **Selling is simpler than you think.** If you decide to sell, we can make an offer and handle everything from home. No driving, no store, no negotiating.

---

## TRUST SIGNALS COPY

### The Standard Since 1981.

The Blue Book of Gun Values wasn't built overnight. It started as a printed reference guide trusted by licensed dealers and serious collectors — the one book shops kept behind the counter to settle pricing disputes.

Over 45 years, it's become the closest thing the firearms industry has to a universal pricing standard.

- **45 years** of continuous price tracking
- **180,000+** firearms in the database
- **Trusted by dealers, appraisers, and estate attorneys** nationwide
- **Updated with real market transaction data** — not manufacturer MSRPs
- **The reference cited** in insurance claims, estate valuations, and court proceedings

*This is the same data professionals pay for. Now it's free.*

## SOCIAL PROOF PLACEHOLDER COPY

*(Templates — drop real testimonials in when collected. Keep the structure, swap the specifics.)*

---

**Template 1 — The Buyer:**
> "I was about to pay $[AMOUNT] for a [GUN MODEL] at a gun show. Checked the Blue Book tool first — it was $[DIFFERENCE] overpriced. Saved me from a bad deal in about 30 seconds."
> — [First Name, Last Initial], [City, State]

---

**Template 2 — The Seller:**
> "Had my [GUN MODEL] sitting in the safe for years. Used the valuation tool, got an InstaCash offer the same day, and had a check in hand [X] days later. Easier than selling a used car."
> — [First Name, Last Initial], [City, State]

---

**Template 3 — The Skeptic:**
> "I've been around guns my whole life and I didn't think I needed a price lookup tool. Then an estate attorney quoted the Blue Book value on a collection I was buying. I started using it after that."
> — [First Name, Last Initial], [Occupation/Context Optional]

---

**Template 4 — The Collector/Researcher:**
> "I use it as a quick sanity check on anything I'm considering. The condition grading guide alone has saved me from overpaying on 'excellent condition' guns that were actually good at best."
> — [First Name, Last Initial], [City, State]

# Here's What That [Make] [Model] Is Worth Right Now.

---

**The Number Block:**

### [Make] [Model] — [Condition] Condition
## $[LOW] – $[HIGH]
*Based on current private-party market data | Updated [Month, Year]*

---

**Below the number — context line:**
This is the private-party market range — what real buyers and sellers are transacting at right now, not what dealers list or what manufacturers suggest.

---

## "IS THIS PRICE FAIR?" CONTEXT COPY

*(Dynamic text block — customize to buyer context. Static version below.)*

---

**What This Range Means for You as a Buyer**

A few things worth knowing before you make an offer:

**The condition grade matters more than people think.**
"Good" condition means the firearm functions reliably and shows normal use — some finish wear, possibly minor scratches. If a seller calls their gun "excellent" and it's got holster wear, that's a $40–$80 difference right there. Use our condition guide *(link)* to grade it yourself before you hand over cash.

**Private party vs. dealer — two different markets.**
Buying from a dealer will typically run $[DEALER_PREMIUM]% higher than this range. You're paying for their warranty, transfer paperwork, and storefront. Buying private party? This range is your number. Don't pay more without a good reason.

**Is the listing you're looking at in this range?**
- Below $[LOW]: Could be a good deal — or could signal an issue with the gun. Ask questions.
- $[LOW] – $[HIGH]: Fair. Reasonable transaction territory.
- Above $[HIGH]: Seller may be testing the market, or has something special (rare variant, original box, low round count). Verify before paying a premium.

---

**Fair Deal Verdict Block** *(optional dynamic element)*:

Based on what you entered:
**A listing at $[USER_PRICE] for this firearm in [CONDITION] condition is: [FAIR / HIGH / LOW]**

*[FAIR]: This is a reasonable market price.*
*[HIGH]: $[AMOUNT] above the current market high. We'd negotiate or keep looking.*
*[LOW]: This is below market. Worth a closer look — but so is why it's priced low.*

## SOFT CTA — STAY IN ECOSYSTEM

---

**Block Header:** Keep This Number Handy.

Gun prices move. What this [Model] is worth today may be different in six months — especially if there's a policy change, a manufacturer discontinuation, or a shift in collector demand. 

We track all of it. If you want us to flag changes to this valuation, or send you market intel on [Category: e.g., "polymer pistols" / "lever-action rifles"], we'll do it. No charge.

**[Button] Watch This Gun's Value →**
*(Saves the lookup to their account / email preference center)*

---

**Secondary soft CTA:**

**Want to understand what makes this gun go up or down in value?**
We wrote a guide on exactly that — covering what factors actually move prices on [Category], and which "upgrades" buyers don't pay a premium for.

## FUTURE SELLER PLANT

*(Subtle. One block. No pressure.)*

---

**Section Header:** If You Ever Decide to Sell...

Circumstances change. The gun you're buying today might be the one you're selling in three years. When that day comes, here's what you should know:

Most sellers either leave money on the table (didn't check the data) or spend more time than it's worth (private sales, no-shows, payment hassles).

We've built a simpler path. When you're ready, come back here, look it up again, and we'll walk you through your options. No obligation. Just information.

## BRIDGE TO INSTACASH

---

**Section Header:** What You Could Actually Get — Depending How You Sell

Not all "selling" is the same. Here's an honest breakdown:

| Selling Method | What You'll Likely Net | Time | Hassle |
|---|---|---|---|
| Private sale (Armslist, etc.) | $[HIGH] range possible | Weeks to months | High — messaging, no-shows, payment risk |
| Dealer trade-in | $[DEALER_LOW] – $[DEALER_HIGH] | Same day | Low — but often store credit only |
| **InstaCash Offer** | **$[ICO_LOW] – $[ICO_HIGH]** | **3–7 days** | **Very low — ship from home** |
| Consignment | Up to $[CONSIGNMENT_HIGH] | 30–90 days | Medium |

*(ICO range is typically comparable to dealer trade-in — sometimes better — with far less friction.)*

---

## ICO PITCH

*(Three pillars: Convenience, Fairness, No Pressure. In plain language.)*

---

**Section Header:** The InstaCash Offer: Here's Exactly How It Works

**Convenience — you don't have to go anywhere.**
We send you a prepaid, insured shipping label. You pack the gun, drop it at a FedEx location, and we handle the rest. No driving to three shops. No standing at a counter while someone lowballs you in front of other customers.

**Fairness — the offer is based on the same data you just saw.**
We don't make up numbers. Our offer is a transparent percentage of the current market value — the same market data that powers the Blue Book. You can see exactly how we arrived at it.

**No pressure — ever.**
You get the offer. You decide. If it doesn't work for you, walk away. No calls, no follow-up, no guilt trip. This is information, not a trap.

**The honest comparison:**
A dealer trade-in usually lands in the same range as our InstaCash Offer. The difference is we don't push store credit, you don't have to drive anywhere, and the process is fully transparent. For most people, that's worth it.

---

## ICO CTA (PRIMARY)

---

**CTA Block:**

### Ready to See Your InstaCash Offer?

No commitment. Takes about 2 minutes to submit. You'll have an offer in [X] business days.

**[Button — Primary] Get My InstaCash Offer →**

*Insured shipping provided. Payment by check or ACH. Licensed, FFL-compliant.*

---

**Below the button — objection handler:**
*Not sure yet? That's fine. Your valuation is saved. Come back when you're ready.*

---

## CONSIGNMENT CTA (SECONDARY)

*(For high-value, collector, or vintage firearms where max price matters more than speed.)*

---

**Section Header:** Have Something Special? Consignment Might Be the Better Play.

InstaCash is built for speed and convenience. But if you're holding a pre-war Winchester, a factory engraved Colt, or anything with documented provenance — you may want to maximize the sale price rather than optimize for ease.

Our consignment program puts your firearm in front of serious collectors and buyers nationwide, with our 45-year reputation behind it.

**It's slower. It's worth it for the right gun.**

Typical consignment timeline: 30–90 days.
Typical return: meaningfully higher than InstaCash for collectible or high-value firearms.

# SECTION 4: BUYER EMAIL SEQUENCE

---

## EMAIL 1 — DAY 0: WELCOME + VALUE CONFIRMATION

**Subject:** Your [Make] [Model] valuation is here
**Preview text:** $[LOW]–$[HIGH] — and here's what that actually means.

---

Hi [First Name],

Here's your valuation for the **[Make] [Model]** in **[Condition]** condition:

**$[LOW] – $[HIGH]**
*Current private-party market range*

That's the range real buyers and sellers are transacting at right now — not MSRP, not dealer asking price, not what someone's hoping to get on a forum.

**A few things worth knowing:**

The condition grade is the biggest variable in this range. "Good" and "Very Good" can mean a $50–$150 difference on most mid-range pistols, and significantly more on collectible rifles and shotguns. If you're evaluating a specific gun, take a few minutes to compare it against our condition definitions before you offer or accept a price.

If the listing you're looking at falls in this range, you're in fair-deal territory. If it's above $[HIGH], ask the seller what justifies the premium. Sometimes there's a legitimate answer (low round count, original packaging, documented history). Sometimes there isn't.

Questions? Hit reply. I read these.

— The Blue Book Team

P.S. — We'll send you a short note in a few days about what actually makes gun values move up or down over time. It's more nuanced than most people think — and useful whether you're buying to use or buying to keep.

## EMAIL 2 — DAY 3: WHAT MAKES GUNS APPRECIATE VS DEPRECIATE

**Subject:** Why that Glock holds its value (and your cousin's AR might not)
**Preview text:** Four factors that actually move gun prices. One surprises most people.

---

Hi [First Name],

You looked up the **[Make] [Model]** a few days ago. Today I want to give you something more useful than a single number — the framework for understanding *why* a gun is worth what it's worth, and what moves that number over time.

After 45 years of tracking prices, these are the factors that consistently matter.

---

**1. Production status**

When a manufacturer discontinues a model, something interesting happens: the price usually dips briefly as the secondary market absorbs remaining inventory — then it climbs as buyers realize new ones aren't coming.

Classic example: Colt stopped making the Python in 1996. By the time they reissued it in 2020, original pre-1996 Pythons had appreciated significantly. The reissue actually *pushed prices higher* on both versions.

The [Make] [Model] is currently **[in production / discontinued since YEAR]**. That affects its long-term value trajectory.

---

**2. Mechanical reputation**

Guns with proven reliability records hold value better than those with a history of recalls, feeding issues, or quality control problems. Buyers remember — especially collectors who buy to hold.

Guns that get cheaper over time: models associated with quality control issues, high-round-count rentals, anything that got a bad reputation in a specific forum era.

Guns that hold value: workhorses with multi-decade reliability records. The Ruger 10/22. The Remington 870 (pre-2010). The Glock 17. The 1911 in any major maker.

---

**3. Cultural/historical significance**

Military issue, law enforcement issue, screen-used, historically significant — any documented connection to a larger story adds collector premium. This isn't irrational. It's provenance.

The challenge: documentation has to be real. "This gun was carried by a WWII vet" moves a price if there's paperwork. Without it, it's a family story, not a value driver.

---

**4. Condition — and specifically, who graded it**

This is the one that surprises people: most sellers overgrade their guns by one full grade. "Excellent" is frequently "Very Good." "Very Good" is often "Good."

At the Blue Book, condition grades have specific, visual definitions. A gun in *actual* Excellent condition shows no wear at all on high-contact surfaces. Not "barely any." None.

Why does this matter to you as a buyer? Because a one-grade difference on a $600 revolver can be $60–$120 in real money. Learn the grading standards and you'll immediately spot when a seller's asking price doesn't match their condition claim.

[Link: Blue Book Condition Grading Guide →]

---

One more thing: the [Make] [Model] you looked up sits in a category that has **[held steady / appreciated / softened]** over the past 18 months. I'll have more on current market trends in a few days.

## EMAIL 3 — DAY 7: MARKET INTELLIGENCE

**Subject:** What's moving in the gun market right now
**Preview text:** Three categories heating up. Two that have cooled. Here's the current picture.

---

Hi [First Name],

Seven days ago you looked up the **[Make] [Model]**. Today: the broader market context — what's moving, what's cooling, and where that gun sits in the current landscape.

*(This is general market intelligence, not a guarantee of future prices. But it's based on what we're actually seeing in transaction data.)*

---

**Categories currently trading strong:**

**Revolvers — especially pre-1980 American-made.**
Smith & Wesson K-frames, Colt Official Police variants, early Ruger Security-Six models. Collector interest has been building steadily. Well-documented examples in Very Good or better condition are moving reliably.

**Lever-action rifles.**
Winchester 94s, Marlin 336s, Henry originals. There's been consistent demand, particularly in .30-30 and .45-70. Less price volatility than semi-auto categories.

**Classic bolt-action hunting rifles.**
Pre-64 Winchester Model 70s are a collector category in their own right. But even post-64 production in popular hunting calibers is moving well — there's generational transfer happening as estates are settled.

---

**Categories that have softened from their 2021–2022 peaks:**

**AR-platform rifles (standard configuration).**
The surge in demand from 2020–2022 corrected significantly. Entry-level to mid-tier ARs are broadly available and prices have normalized. This isn't bad news if you're buying. It's a buyer's market for standard configurations.

**Standard-production semi-auto pistols.**
The Glock 17, the M&P 2.0, the Springfield Hellcat — all well-supplied. Prices are fair, negotiating room exists. Not a scarcity situation right now.

---

**Where the [Make] [Model] fits:**

[DYNAMIC CATEGORY CONTEXT — insert relevant market note for the gun's category]

The $[LOW]–$[HIGH] range you saw last week is current. For guns in this category, values have been [stable / softening / trending up] over the past 90 days.

## EMAIL 4 — DAY 21: SOFT SELL PLANT

**Subject:** A quick note about the [Make] [Model]
**Preview text:** Not selling it? That's fine. Just worth knowing this option exists.

---

Hi [First Name],

Three weeks ago you looked up the **[Make] [Model]**.

I don't know your situation — maybe you bought it, maybe you're still deciding, maybe you just wanted to know what was in your safe. All of those are valid reasons to check.

But I want to mention something, because I'd rather tell you now than have you find out later through a Google search or a dealer's lowball offer:

**If you ever decide to sell a firearm — this one or any other — there's a better path than most people know about.**

Most people either:
- List it privately (Armslist, Gun Broker, local classifieds) and spend weeks dealing with flakes, low offers, and the friction of a cash transaction with a stranger
- Walk into a dealer and take whatever trade-in offer they give, often in store credit

We built an alternative. It's called InstaCash Offers. It works like this:

1. Enter the firearm details — same as you did here
2. Get a transparent cash offer based on current market data
3. If you accept: we send a prepaid insured shipping label, you ship it, we send payment

No driving. No haggling. No store credit. No pressure.

The offer is typically comparable to a dealer trade-in — sometimes better. The difference is the process is completely on your terms.

I'm not pushing you to sell. If the [Make] [Model] is in your safe and it's staying there, great. But now you know the option exists, from people whose literal job for 45 years has been knowing what guns are worth.

## EMAIL 5 — DAY 60: RE-ENGAGEMENT

**Subject:** Still thinking about that [Make] [Model]?
**Preview text:** Prices shifted a bit since you checked. Here's the current number.

---

Hi [First Name],

About two months ago you looked up the **[Make] [Model]**.

Thought you'd want the updated number:

**[Make] [Model] | [Condition] Condition**
**Current range: $[UPDATED_LOW] – $[UPDATED_HIGH]**

[This is [up / down / unchanged] from when you checked in [Month].]

Gun prices aren't static — they respond to supply, demand, cultural events, manufacturer decisions, and secondary market trends. We track all of it.

If you're still in a buying or research mode, the market for [Category] is [brief current context — e.g., "well-supplied right now, no shortage premium"].

If your situation has changed and you're now thinking about selling — the [Run a Seller Valuation] link below gives you a full breakdown of what you could get through different channels.

Either way, you now have the current number.

## EMAIL 1 — DAY 0: WELCOME + VALUATION RECAP + ICO CTA

**Subject:** Your [Make] [Model] valuation — and what to do with it
**Preview text:** $[LOW]–$[HIGH] is the market range. Here's what that means for your options.

---

Hi [First Name],

Here's your valuation:

**[Make] [Model] | [Condition] Condition**
**Private-party market range: $[LOW] – $[HIGH]**

This is what your gun is actually trading for between buyers and sellers right now. It's the same data licensed dealers use — now available free, because you should know what you have before you decide what to do with it.

---

**Your selling options, honestly compared:**

**Private sale** — potentially the highest net, but also the most work. Listing, messaging, vetting buyers, arranging transfer. If you've done it before, you know the drill. Takes time and patience.

**Dealer trade-in** — fast and easy, but you're typically looking at [ESTIMATED TRADE RANGE] for this firearm, often as store credit rather than cash.

**InstaCash Offer** — our direct-purchase program. Typically in the same range as a dealer trade-in, occasionally better. The difference: you don't leave home. We send a prepaid insured label, you ship the gun, we send you money.

If convenience matters to you at all — the process is genuinely simple. Takes about 2 minutes to request an offer.

**[Button] Request My InstaCash Offer →**

No obligation. The offer is free to request and free to decline.

— The Blue Book Team

*P.S. — If you're holding something collectible or high-value, there's a consignment option too. I'll mention that in a future email — but InstaCash is the right starting point for most guns.*

---

## EMAIL 2 — DAY 2: OVERCOME OBJECTIONS — "IS ICO REALLY FAIR?"

**Subject:** "Will I get ripped off?" — Fair question. Here's the honest answer.
**Preview text:** We get it. Here's exactly how the offer is calculated.

---

Hi [First Name],

Since you looked up the **[Make] [Model]** two days ago, I want to address something directly.

The most common reaction when people hear "we'll buy your gun" is some version of: *yeah, but you're going to lowball me.*

It's a fair reaction. Most buyback programs, dealer trade-ins, and "we buy guns" operations have conditioned people to expect exactly that.

So let me be transparent about how InstaCash Offers actually works.

---

**How the offer is calculated:**

Our offer is a defined percentage of the current Blue Book market value for your specific make, model, and condition.

That percentage is disclosed upfront. It doesn't change after you ship the gun. It doesn't get adjusted based on us deciding the condition is suddenly worse than you described (within reason — we do a basic verification, but we're not looking for excuses to renegotiate).

The math: if the market value for your **[Make] [Model]** in **[Condition]** condition is $[MID_VALUE], our offer is approximately $[OFFER_ESTIMATE].

That's typically in the same range as a dealer trade-in — without the drive, without the waiting room, and without pressure to take store credit.

---

**What you might get elsewhere:**

Private sale: potentially up to $[HIGH], but factor in time, hassle, and transfer logistics.

Dealer trade-in: probably $[DEALER_LOW]–$[DEALER_HIGH], frequently as store credit.

InstaCash: approximately $[ICO_ESTIMATE], cash, shipped from home.

---

**What InstaCash isn't:**

It's not the maximum money you can get. If you want maximum, private sale or consignment is the path. InstaCash is the maximum *convenience* option at a fair price — not a great price that took you six weeks to get.

The right question isn't "is this the most money?" It's "is this a fair, transparent transaction that saves me real time and hassle?" For most people, the answer is yes.

## EMAIL 3 — DAY 5: SOCIAL PROOF — SELLER STORY

**Subject:** How [First Name — SELLER TESTIMONIAL SUBJECT] got [$AMOUNT] for her grandfather's [Gun]
**Preview text:** She didn't know what it was worth. Now she does — and it's sold.

*(NOTE TO TEAM: Replace this template with a real seller story when available. The structure below is designed to convert. Use this framework verbatim, swap in real details.)*

---

Hi [First Name],

I want to share a story that's pretty common in what we do.

[SELLER NAME] reached out to us about a [MAKE MODEL] that had been in her family for [X] years. Her [father/grandfather/uncle] had left it to her. She didn't know what it was worth, didn't really want to keep it, and didn't know how to sell a gun without walking into a gun store and feeling completely out of her element.

Here's what she told us:

*"I looked up the value on the Blue Book site, honestly just curious. The number surprised me — it was worth more than I thought. Then the page told me I could request an offer and they'd send a shipping label. I didn't have to go anywhere. I printed the label, dropped it at FedEx on my lunch break, and had money in my account [X] days later. I don't know why I waited so long to deal with it."*

The gun: [MAKE MODEL] in [CONDITION] condition.
Her InstaCash offer: $[AMOUNT].
Her assessment: "Fair, easy, and nobody made me feel dumb for not knowing guns."

---

That last part matters to us. A lot of people come to us in situations where they've inherited a firearm, or they're clearing out a collection they're no longer active with, or they're simplifying their safe and don't want the negotiation dance.

You shouldn't need to be a gun expert to get a fair price for a gun.

The **[Make] [Model]** you looked up is worth $[LOW]–$[HIGH] in today's market. If you want a straightforward path to selling it, the offer takes 2 minutes to request.

## EMAIL 4 — DAY 10: URGENCY/TIMING — MARKET IS STRONG

**Subject:** Quick heads up on the market for [Category]
**Preview text:** It's a good time to sell [Category] — here's why.

---

Hi [First Name],

Just a data point worth knowing before you decide what to do with the **[Make] [Model]**.

[Category — e.g., "Revolvers" / "Bolt-action rifles" / "Classic semi-auto pistols"] is currently trading well. We're seeing consistent buyer demand, healthy transaction velocity, and the kind of pricing that generally means sellers are getting fair market value without sitting on listings for months.

**Why that matters for you:**

Gun markets move. What's in demand today may not be in six months — policy uncertainty, seasonal patterns, and manufacturer announcements can all shift the secondary market faster than most people expect.

I'm not telling you the sky is falling or that you need to decide this week. The **[Make] [Model]** will still be worth something six months from now.

But if you've been on the fence, the current market is about as favorable as conditions get for this category. The buyers are there. The prices are solid. And the friction of selling through InstaCash is about as low as it gets.

**[Make] [Model] | [Condition] | Current range: $[LOW]–$[HIGH]**

You looked up the **[Make] [Model]** about a month ago, and I want to give you a straight answer on something.

If you've been hesitant about InstaCash — maybe you think the offer will be lower than what you want, or the gun has history or collector appeal that makes you feel like you should get more — you might be right.

InstaCash is built for speed and simplicity. For a standard production firearm in good to very good condition, it's usually the right call. You get a fair price, zero hassle, done.

But some guns aren't standard. If yours falls into any of these categories, consignment is worth a conversation:

- **Pre-war or early post-war production** (pre-1960 for most American manufacturers)
- **Factory special order features** (engraving, custom wood, unusual calibers)
- **Documented provenance** — military issue, law enforcement issue, known owner
- **Unfired or near-unfired condition** in the original box with all papers
- **Limited production variants** with documented collector following

For these guns, the difference between a quick sale and a properly marketed consignment sale can be meaningful — sometimes 20–40% more.

Our consignment program places your firearm with our established network of collectors and serious buyers. We handle the listing, the vetting, and the transfer. You wait for the right buyer instead of the fastest one.

**The honest tradeoff:** It takes longer. Usually 30–90 days. But if your gun has genuine collector value, it's worth the wait.

## RE-ENGAGEMENT: BUYER PATH

**Subject:** Hey — still thinking about the [Make] [Model]?
**Preview text:** Prices have moved since you checked. Figured you'd want to know.

---

Hi [First Name],

It's been about three months since you looked up the **[Make] [Model]**.

I don't know if you bought it, passed on it, or just set it aside for later. Either way, I figured a quick update was worth a minute of your time.

**Current market range: $[UPDATED_LOW] – $[UPDATED_HIGH]**

[This is [up $X / down $X / essentially unchanged] from when you checked in [Month].]

That's it. No pitch. Just the number, updated.

If you're still in research or buying mode and want to dig into current market conditions — or if your situation changed and you're now thinking about selling something — the tool is free, it takes 30 seconds, and it's still powered by the same data it always was.

## RE-ENGAGEMENT: SELLER PATH

**Subject:** That [Make] [Model] still in the safe?
**Preview text:** Market's still there. The option hasn't changed. Just checking in.

Hi [First Name],

Three months ago you looked up the **[Make] [Model]** and what it was worth.

I'm guessing the gun is still in your safe — and that's fine. No one's waiting on you.

But I know that "I'll deal with it later" can quietly turn into years, and I'd rather check in once than have you forget the option exists.

**Current valuation: $[UPDATED_LOW] – $[UPDATED_HIGH]**

If you're ready to move it, the InstaCash path is still the same: 2 minutes to request an offer, prepaid shipping label, cash in a few days. Nothing has changed on our end.

If you're not ready — also fine. The valuation tool is free anytime you want to recheck the number.

**[Button] Get a Fresh Offer →**
**[Link] Just check the current value →**

No follow-up if you don't respond. Just wanted to make sure you still had the option on your radar.

*P.S. — If the gun sold, or if you'd rather not hear from us, unsubscribe below. Genuinely no hard feelings.*
