# Soft Launch Best Practices for Marketplace Platforms

> **Research Date:** 2026-01-28
> **Context:** GunStreamer - Live commerce platform for FFLs ("Whatnot for guns")
> **Current Status:** Pre-launch, some FFLs already onboarded

---

## Executive Summary

Successful marketplace soft launches share common patterns: constrain supply intentionally, obsess over early seller success, build social proof before scaling, and measure engagement over revenue. For GunStreamer specifically, the FFL licensing requirement is actually an advantage - it creates natural scarcity and trust signals.

**Key Insight from Whatnot's Launch:** They started with a single category (Funko Pops) and 10 passionate sellers before expanding. They didn't try to be everything to everyone on day one.

## 2. Building Momentum with Early Users

### The "White Glove" Phase (First 10-20 Sellers)

1. **Concierge Onboarding**
   - Personal call with every FFL before first stream
   - Walk through the platform together
   - Help them plan their first stream's inventory
   - Be available during their first live stream

2. **Guaranteed Audience**
   - For early streams, drive your own audience (BBGV list, personal network)
   - Better to have 50 engaged viewers than 500 randoms
   - FFLs need to see sales happen to believe in the platform

3. **Early Win Amplification**
   - Share every successful sale on social
   - Send personal congratulations after first sale
   - Feature their wins in your newsletter
   - Create case studies from first sellers

## 3. Content/Marketing During Soft Launch

### What Works

| Content Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Behind-the-Scenes | "Building GunStreamer: Week 3" updates |
| Seller Spotlight | "Meet [FFL Name]: Why they chose live commerce" |
| Trust-Building | Scam stories, FFL verification process |
| Educational | "What is live commerce?" |
| Win Documentation | "First Desert Eagle sold live on GunStreamer" |

### Content Calendar Framework

| Day | Content Type |
|-----|-------------|
| Monday | Seller spotlight |
| Wednesday | Educational |
| Friday | Win/Milestone |
| Weekend | Behind-scenes |

**Platform Priority:** Twitter/X (gun community active, thread format works)

---

## 4. Onboarding First 10-50 Sellers

### Sequencing

| Phase | Sellers | Approach |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Founding | 1-10 | Hand-picked, high-touch, feedback-focused |
| Validation | 11-25 | Referred, less hand-holding, test self-service |
| Scale | 26-50 | Self-service onboarding, group support |

### Acquisition Channels

1. Personal network/referrals
2. Direct outreach (FFLs doing live sales on Facebook)
3. Trade shows (SHOT Show)
4. Content marketing (SEO for "live commerce for FFLs")

---

## 5. Metrics That Matter

### Primary Metrics (Obsess Over These)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Seller Retention (30-day) | >60% streaming again |
| Stream Completion Rate | >90% complete without issue |
| GMV per Stream | Trending up week-over-week |
| Repeat Buyer Rate | >20% within 30 days |
| Seller NPS | >50 |

### When to Scale (Exit Soft Launch)

**Green Lights:**
- Seller retention >60% at 30 days
- Stream completion rate >90%
- GMV/stream growing or stable
- Can onboard sellers without founder involvement
- Support load manageable

1. **FFL Requirement = Built-in Trust** - Every seller is verified
2. **BBGV List = Launch Audience** - 180K emails of firearms enthusiasts
3. **Niche = Focus** - Depth over breadth

### Recommended Soft Launch Sequence

| Month | Focus | Target |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation | 5-10 hand-picked FFLs |
| 2 | Validation | 15-25 FFLs, test self-service |
| 3 | Scale Prep | 25-50 FFLs, automated onboarding |
