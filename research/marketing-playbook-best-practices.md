## 1. Content Calendar Structures for Weekly Execution

### The 4-1-1 Rule (Curate, Create, Convert)
Most sustainable weekly cadence for small teams:

| Day | Content Type | Purpose | Example (Rentagun) |
|-----|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Mon | Educational | Build authority | "3 Questions to Ask Before Buying a Handgun" |
| Tue | Social proof | Build trust | Customer photo/review |
| Wed | Curated | Add value | Share interesting industry article |
| Thu | Behind-scenes | Build connection | Inventory arrival, team at work |
| Fri | Direct offer | Convert | "Weekend special" or featured rental |
| Sat | Engagement | Community | Poll, question, or user-generated content |
| Sun | Planning/Rest | - | Schedule next week |

### The Minimum Viable Calendar
For one-person marketing (Troy's situation):

**Non-negotiable weekly:**
1. 1 email newsletter (your owned audience)
2. 3 social posts (your rented audience)
3. 1 long-form piece monthly (your SEO asset)

**Rule:** Email first, always. It's the only channel you own.

## 2. Email Sequence Frameworks

### Welcome Sequence (5-7 emails over 14 days)

| Email # | Send Timing | Purpose | Subject Line Formula |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | Immediate | Deliver promise + set expectations | "Welcome to [Brand] - here's what's next" |
| 2 | Day 2 | Origin story + credibility | "Why we started [Brand]" |
| 3 | Day 4 | Best content/value | "Our most popular [resource/product]" |
| 4 | Day 7 | Social proof | "What [X] customers say about us" |
| 5 | Day 10 | Soft CTA | "Ready to [primary action]?" |
| 6 | Day 12 | Objection handling | "The #1 question we get about [product]" |
| 7 | Day 14 | Direct offer | "Special for new subscribers" |

### Abandoned Cart Sequence (3-4 emails over 48-72 hours)

**Timing is everything:** 50% of abandoned cart revenue recovered comes from the first email sent within 1 hour.

| Email # | Send Timing | Approach | Subject Line |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | 1 hour | Helpful reminder | "Did something go wrong?" |
| 2 | 24 hours | Create urgency | "Your [item] is waiting" |
| 3 | 48 hours | Overcome objection | "[Common objection]? Here's the truth" |
| 4 | 72 hours | Final offer | "Last chance: [incentive]" |

### Post-Purchase Sequence (4-5 emails over 30 days)

| Email # | Send Timing | Purpose | Subject Line |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Immediate | Confirmation + excitement | "Your order is confirmed!" |
| 2 | Shipping | Tracking + anticipation | "[Product] is on its way" |
| 3 | Day 3-5 post-delivery | Check-in + usage tips | "How's [product] working for you?" |
| 4 | Day 14 | Request review | "Quick favor? (takes 30 seconds)" |
| 5 | Day 30 | Cross-sell/repeat | "Based on your purchase..." |

## 3. Social Media Strategy Templates

### The "Content Pillars" System

**Pick 3-5 pillars. Never post outside them.**

| Pillar | Content Types | Posting Ratio |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Educational | How-to, tips, guides | 40% |
| Social Proof | Reviews, UGC, testimonials | 20% |
| Behind-Scenes | Process, team, day-in-life | 20% |
| Promotional | Products, offers, CTAs | 15% |
| Engagement | Polls, questions, trends | 5% |

### Platform-Specific Cadence

| Platform | Posts/Week | Best Content Types | Best Times |
|----------|------------|-------------------|------------|
| Twitter/X | 5-7 | Threads, hot takes, engagement | 8-10am, 12-1pm |
| Instagram | 3-5 | Carousels, Reels, Stories | 11am, 7-9pm |
| Facebook | 3-4 | Long-form, video, community | 1-4pm |
| LinkedIn | 2-3 | Industry insight, founder stories | 7-8am, 5-6pm |

### The "Hook Bank" System

| Hook Type | Formula | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Contrarian | "[Common belief] is wrong. Here's why:" | "Researching guns for weeks is wrong. Here's why:" |
| Curiosity | "The [unexpected thing] about [topic]" | "The unexpected thing about renting before buying" |
| Proof | "[Specific number] [result] in [timeframe]" | "216 firearms. Zero buyer's remorse." |
| Problem-agitate | "Stop [painful action]. Start [better alternative]." | "Stop researching. Start shooting." |
| Direct | "[Do this] to [get result]" | "Rent it Saturday. Decide Sunday." |
