# Brand Voice Documentation Best Practices

> Research compiled from: Mailchimp, Stripe, Slack, Shopify, Salesforce, Buffer, Zendesk

---

## The Core Insight

The best brand voice docs share three traits:
1. **Immediately usable** - no training needed
2. **Concrete examples** - real do/don't samples
3. **Scannable** - find what you need in 30 seconds

**Ideal length:** 1,500-2,500 words

---

## Essential Sections (in order of importance)

### 1. Voice Attributes (3-4 max)

Format: **"[ATTRIBUTE] but not [EXTREME]"**

Example (Mailchimp):
- "Fun but not silly"
- "Confident but not cocky"

**Why it works:** More than 4 attributes = no one remembers them

---

### 2. Do/Don't Examples (Most Critical Section)

- 15-20 paired examples across actual content types
- Show scenario, wrong version, right version, and WHY
- Cover: headlines, CTAs, errors, emails, support responses

**Paired Example Method (Best):**
```
SCENARIO: User completes first order

DON'T: "Congratulations! Your order has been successfully placed! 🎉🎉"
Problem: Excessive, feels automated

DO: "You're all set. Your rental ships Monday."
Why: Warm but restrained, actionable info
```

**Spectrum Method:**
```
TOO CASUAL: "Whoops! Something broke."
TOO FORMAL: "An error has occurred. Please contact support."
JUST RIGHT: "Something went wrong. Try again, or contact us if it keeps happening."
```

### 3. Tone Spectrum by Context

Voice stays constant, **tone flexes**.

| Context | Reader State | Tone Adjustment |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Marketing | Curious, evaluating | Enthusiastic, confident |
| Errors | Frustrated, confused | Serious, empathetic, helpful |
| Support | Needs help | Patient, clear, reassuring |
| Transactional | Just wants info | Direct, efficient |

---

### 4. Word Lists (Use/Avoid)

This section gets referenced constantly - make it scannable.

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Power words** (use often) | [brand-specific] |
| **Avoid words** (with reasons) | "Just", "Simply" (dismissive) |
| **Banned words** (hard no) | [brand-specific terms] |

---

### 5. Audience Quick Notes

Brief persona snapshots:
- What they want
- What they fear
- Tone adjustment for them

---

## What Makes Voice Docs Actually Usable

1. **30-Second Test** - Can a new writer find what they need in 30 seconds?
2. **Real examples from your content** - Not generic samples
3. **Before/After rewrites** - Shows how to fix existing copy

### Two-Document Approach

| Document | Length | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Quick Reference | 1 page | Attributes, power words, top 5 do/don'ts |
| Full Guide | 3-5 pages | Complete examples, tone spectrum, edge cases |
