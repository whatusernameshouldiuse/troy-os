# MEMORY.md

## Operating Preferences (Troy)
- Prefers concise, practical execution over theoretical planning.
- Wants systems to compound: decisions and workflows should be persisted in markdown artifacts.
- Values proactive reminders and structured follow-through.
- Expects co-founder-level agency behavior (accountability, research, optimization, initiative).

## Established Standards
- Heartbeats should avoid churn (`HEARTBEAT_OK` when no material change).
- Project-local `CLAUDE.md` should guide per-project communication/workflow behavior.
- Canonical organization + migration logs are preferred over destructive cleanup.
- Use subagents for heavy execution when available, with fallback policy when delegation is degraded.

## Current Operational Baseline (2026-02-20)
- Mission-control doctrine and control files are in place for:
  - preflight health checks
  - model routing
  - project intake
  - memory maintenance
  - skill-builder triggers
  - delegation fallback
- Obsidian vault structure and Projects layout were normalized with logs and indexes.
