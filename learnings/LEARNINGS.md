# LEARNINGS.md

Purpose: capture mistakes, corrections, and rule updates so errors compound into better execution.

## Rule
Every time my agent makes a mistake, it logs the correction and updates its own rules.

## Logged Learnings

- Date: 2026-02-22
- Mistake: Started Rentagun GTM/tracking build in a generic framework instead of explicitly anchoring to the existing deep-research ICP/persona artifacts.
- Correction: Re-anchored execution standard so Rentagun assets must be persona-first and validated against ICP before publish.
- Root cause: Context recall drift during rapid execution.
- Rule update: For Rentagun, always load ICP/persona docs first and require an "ICP Fit Check" section in every LP/email/ad deliverable.
- Prevention check: Before any Rentagun publish recommendation, verify: persona pain points, objections, triggers, and message-match are explicitly mapped.
