### OutdoorInfluencers.io
- **Website:** outdoorinfluencers.io (landing page HTML ready to deploy)
- **What:** Marketplace + mastermind connecting outdoor creators (hunting/fishing/shooting, 1K–50K followers) with brands
- **Anchor brands:** Rentagun + GunStreamer (BBGV removed from sprint 2026-02-23 — different product, not affiliate model)
- **Revenue model (current):** Free → Pro ($29-49/mo) → Mastermind ($97-197/mo) + 10-15% transaction fee
- **Revenue model (J recommended, pending Troy review):** Pro $49/mo committed, Mastermind $149/mo w/ results guarantee, brand fees $299/$399/$599, transaction fee 10% flat
- **Core promise:** Creator earns $500+ in 14 days (Rentagun $300 + GunStreamer $200 = $500 minimum)
- **Status:** Phase 0+1 Foundation complete — marketing psychology, pricing, 125 ideas, launch strategy, free tool, website copy, content strategy all done
- **Cold outreach system:** 5-file package in `Projects/OutdoorInfluencers/Cold-Outreach-System/` — stack: Snov.io + n8n (have) + Resend + Airtable. J operates full pipeline. Needs Snov.io creds + sending domain + Instagram account.
- **Email warm-up:** Must start immediately once sending domain confirmed — 14-day lead before cold emails fire. DM outreach can start now.
- **Must-fix before creator outreach:** Email 4 proof data is fabricated (FTC risk) — label as projected OR hold until Cohort 1 real data. Also: GunStreamer pre-launch, drop from Sprint Cohort 1.
- **Files (iCloud vault):** `Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Work/Projects/Outdoor Influencers/`
- **Files (Obsidian):** `Projects/OutdoorInfluencers/` and `Projects/Outdoor Influencers/Phase-0-Foundation/` + `Phase-1-PreLaunch/`

- **Status:** ✅ LIVE — platform is operational, streams happening
- **Email list:** ~120K contacts in Klaviyo (14 wave/batch lists, zero emails sent to most of them)
- **Homepage problem:** Home shows blank app embed. All marketing is at /dealercontact. Homepage redesign brief written: `Projects/GunStreamer/Homepage-Redesign-Brief-2026-02-24.md`
- **Branding:** Deep navy bg, red/coral accent (#e84444), circular crosshair logo, bold uppercase headlines
