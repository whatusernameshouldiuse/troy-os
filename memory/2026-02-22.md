## Project Status (as of EOD Sunday)

### BBGV — Email / Lifecycle + Deliverability Recovery
- Status: **In Progress**
- Root cause triage for spam placement in Klaviyo not yet completed
- Next required action: pull campaign metrics (complaint rate, bounce, unsub, domain perf) and diagnose
- Must send to engaged-only segment while deliverability is being recovered

### BBGV — Subscription-Free Transition (ICO + Consignment)
- Status: **In Progress**
- Website triggers not yet implemented
- ICO vs consignment routing paths need to be built out
- Next: trigger handoff to dev + confirm implementation ETA

### GTM / CMO Audit System
- Status: **In Progress**
- First-pass scorecard not yet filled
- Top-10 bottleneck task list not yet produced
- Subagent deliverables incoming — need to be converted to owner-assigned launch tasks

### Rentagun — Acquisition System
- Active subagent: `rentagun-acq-system-v1` (background)

### BBGV — Content Machine
- Active subagent: `bbgv-content-machine-v1` (background)

### Ops Automation / Bottomline
- Active subagent: `ops-automation-bottomline` (background)

## Decisions / Blockers

- **Browser relay attach** remains unreliable → API publishing path is the fallback
- **Subagent pairing** intermittently degrades → fallback policy (DELEGATION-FALLBACK-POLICY.md) is active
- **Owner decisions still pending:**
  - Approve/install flagged third-party skills (case-by-case)
  - Confirm scope for Gmail/X agent-account ingestion rollout

## Notes

- Session nearing compaction — captured state to preserve continuity
- Main session context is heavy (272k tokens); consider clearing or trimming when convenient
- All mission-control doctrine files from 2026-02-20 remain in place and wired into heartbeat preflight
