## What Was Built Today (Full Session Recap)

### 1. BBGV Klaviyo Deliverability Triage
- Email campaign went to spam — triage initiated
- Decision: pause broad sends, send engaged-only segment (30/60d openers) while fixing
- Root cause not yet fully diagnosed — needs Klaviyo metrics screenshots to go deeper
- **Next:** Pull complaint %, bounce %, unsub %, and per-domain opens from Klaviyo

### 2. DRR Skill Created (Deep Research Researcher)
- New skill: `skills/drr-researcher/SKILL.md`
- Generates 500 Deep Research prompts/month to upgrade the agent system
- First batch generated: `mission-control/deep-research/2026-03-prompts.md`

### 3. Agent Accounts Setup
- Checklist created for dedicated Gmail + X (agent-only) accounts
- `mission-control/AGENT-ACCOUNTS-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md`
- Also mirrored to `Work/01 Command Center/AGENT-ACCOUNTS-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` in Obsidian
- Purpose: let J ingest Troy's bookmarks + Gmail to self-improve on signals Troy sees

### 4. Obsidian Fixes + Vault Reorganization
- Diagnosed vault freeze: 1.45GB `Projects` folder + heavy plugins
- Disabled `mcp-tools` + `obsidian-local-rest-api` plugins (heavy, non-essential)
- Tightened `.obsidianignore` to skip heavy code/archive folders
- Disabled `obsidian-git` (kept Tasks + Kanban active)
- Archived duplicate Operator OS tree → `_archive/2026-02-22-operator-os-duplicate-tree/`
- Cleanup log: `Work/01 Command Center/VAULT-MIGRATION-LOG-2026-02-22.md`
- Root cleanup: `Work/01 Command Center/ROOT-CLEANUP-2026-02-22.md`

### 5. GitHub + Obsidian Weight Decision
- **Decision:** Obsidian = notes/strategy/ops ONLY (keep lightweight)
- **Decision:** Code/heavy assets → GitHub repos per project (BBGV, Rentagun, GunStreamer)

### 6. LEARNINGS.md (Self-Improving Rule)
- Created `learnings/LEARNINGS.md`
- Rule: every agent mistake gets logged + rules updated (corrections compound into improvements)

### 7. Obsidian-First Output Rule (New Agent Behavior)
- Added to `AGENTS.md`: every time a user-facing file is created/updated, immediately open it in Obsidian
- Always include exact file path + preview in reply
- Prefer single LIVE draft files for iterative work

### 8. DataForSEO API Wired Up
- Decision: start with DataForSEO only (Keywords Everywhere not added yet)
- Secure setup: `~/.secrets/dataforseo.env` + direnv per project
- Gateway wrapper: `~/.openclaw/gateway-run.sh` loads secrets into LaunchAgent process
- DataForSEO login + password confirmed as `set` in env
- KE key intentionally left empty until needed

### 9. BBGV SEO/AEO Blog Content System (LIVE)
**Files created in Obsidian:**
- `Work/Projects/BBGV/05-Content-Systems/BBGV-SEO-AEO-BLOG-SYSTEM-LIVE.md`
- `Work/Projects/BBGV/05-Content-Systems/BBGV-BLOG-SKILLS-MODEL-ROUTING-LIVE.md`
- `Work/Projects/BBGV/05-Content-Systems/BBGV-0.1PCT-CONTENT-SYSTEM-LIVE.md`

**Workflow locked:**
- Troy sends: screenshot(s) + BBGV data for a firearm/topic
- J builds: brief → draft → SEO/AEO optimize → image prompts → email/social pack
- No manual intent selection — intent is inferred, dual-path CTA always included
- **CTA default:** ICO (speed) + Consignment (max value) on every piece
- Existing BBGV blogs = templates; all new output pattern-matches them

**Skill stack by step:**
- Research: `ai-seo`, `content-strategy`, DataForSEO API
- Draft: `copywriting`, `copy-editing`
- SEO/AEO: `ai-seo`
- Competitor: `competitor-alternatives`
- Images: `ad-creative` (NOT `copywriting` — Troy corrected this)
- Email: `email-sequence`

**Model routing:**
- GPT-5.3 Codex → strategy, core drafts
- Sonnet 4.6 → formatting, schema blocks, variant generation, cleanup

**Weekly cadence locked:**
- 3 blogs/week
- 2 emails/week (warm to 3)
- 9 socials/week
- KPI king: ICO starts/offers
- Lead magnet needed for newsletter subscriber growth (topic TBD)

### 10. Rentagun GTM + Acquisition System (LIVE)
**File created in Obsidian:**
- `Work/Projects/Rentagun/Marketing/RAG-TRACKING-SUBSCRIPTION-GTM-LIVE.md`

**Key decisions:**
- AvantLink = tracking for single rentals
- Subscription tracking = needs separate solution (open)
- ICP/persona fit check mandatory before any copy/LP/ad ships
- Troy previously did deep research ICP — anchor all assets to that persona

### 11. Subagents Spawned
- **bbgv-content-machine-v1** → 30-day topic clusters, lead magnet, week-1 calendar, 2-email plan, 1 full blog pack
- **rentagun-acq-system-v1** → ICP-anchored acquisition funnel, LP/email/ad assets, KPI scoreboard, 14-day launch plan
- **ops-automation-bottomline** → background ops automation

---

## Active Decisions / Pending
- Klaviyo metrics screenshots still needed from Troy to complete deliverability triage
- Subscription tracking solution for Rentagun TBD
- Lead magnet concept for BBGV newsletter — not yet chosen
- Keywords Everywhere API — intentionally on hold
- Agent Gmail + X accounts — checklist ready, Troy to execute setup

## Blockers
- Browser relay attach remains unreliable (API publishing path is fallback)
- Subagent pairing intermittently degrades (fallback policy active)
- Klaviyo direct access limited without browser relay
