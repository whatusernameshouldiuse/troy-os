## Project Status (as of EOD Sunday)

### BBGV — Email / Lifecycle + Deliverability Recovery
- Status: **In Progress**
- Root cause triage for spam placement in Klaviyo not yet completed
- Next required action: pull campaign metrics (complaint rate, bounce, unsub, domain perf) and diagnose
- Must send to engaged-only segment while deliverability is being recovered

### BBGV — Subscription-Free Transition (ICO + Consignment)
- Status: **In Progress**
- Website triggers not yet implemented
- ICO vs consignment routing paths need to be built out
- Next: trigger handoff to dev + confirm implementation ETA

### GTM / CMO Audit System
- Status: **In Progress**
- First-pass scorecard not yet filled
- Top-10 bottleneck task list not yet produced
- Subagent deliverables incoming — need to be converted to owner-assigned launch tasks

### Rentagun — Acquisition System
- Active subagent: `rentagun-acq-system-v1` (background)

### BBGV — Content Machine
- Active subagent: `bbgv-content-machine-v1` (background)

### Ops Automation / Bottomline
- Active subagent: `ops-automation-bottomline` (background)

---

## Decisions / Blockers

- **Browser relay attach** remains unreliable → API publishing path is the fallback
- **Subagent pairing** intermittently degrades → fallback policy (DELEGATION-FALLBACK-POLICY.md) is active
- **Owner decisions still pending:**
  - Approve/install flagged third-party skills (case-by-case)
  - Confirm scope for Gmail/X agent-account ingestion rollout

## What Was Built (Recent Sessions — Feb 21–22)

### BBGV — Blog Teaser Email (Luger P08)
- **File:** `projects/bbgv/campaigns/2026-02-blog-teaser/luger-p08-blog-teaser-email.md`
- **Campaign:** Cold Warm-Up Batch 002 (`S3k2tf`) — 2,000 contacts
- **Blog:** "The Luger P08: The Most Coveted WWII Bring-Back"
- **Status:** Ready for Klaviyo — needs template creation + campaign setup in Klaviyo
- **Strategy:** Blog-to-email content loop — use high-interest SEO content (WWII bring-backs) to warm cold list and drive valuation signups

### BBGV — Content/Email Strategy
- Playbook structured around "The Blue Book Brief" weekly newsletter (Thursdays, 9am EST)
- Blog cadence: 1 post/week minimum (Tuesdays) — rotate inheritor content, gun-specific guides, market trends
- Email list (180K) is primary asset; content machine feeds list + converts free → paid ($10/$30 SaaS)
- Subagent `bbgv-content-machine-v1` running in background to execute this

### Rentagun — Customer Acquisition System
- **File:** `projects/rentagun/MARKETING-PLAYBOOK.md` (comprehensive)
- Content calendars built out through end of March: `content/2026-02-content-calendar.md`, `content/2026-03-content-calendar.md`
- Social campaigns built week-by-week through March 31 (6 campaign folders)
- Win-back email sequence: `email-sequences/WIN-BACK-SEQUENCE.md`
- ICPs defined: The Considerer, Experience Seeker, Hunter, New Gun Owner
- Subagent `rentagun-acq-system-v1` running in background to execute

## Notes

- Session nearing compaction — captured state to preserve continuity
- Main session context is heavy (272k tokens); consider clearing or trimming when convenient
- All mission-control doctrine files from 2026-02-20 remain in place and wired into heartbeat preflight
