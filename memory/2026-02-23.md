# Daily Notes — 2026-02-23 (Monday)

---

## Infrastructure Fixes

**Gateway LaunchAgent was broken (resolved)**
- Root cause: plist missing `gateway` subcommand + pending device re-approval after reinstall
- Fix: `openclaw gateway install --force` → `openclaw gateway restart` → `openclaw devices approve <id>`
- Sub-agent spawn now confirmed healthy (hourly preflight checks passing all day)
- Logged in `mission-control/ops-log.md`

**WhatsApp gateway** had two brief disconnects (status 499) — self-healed in ~3 seconds both times, no action needed.

**BRAIN.md updated:** removed stale "subagent pairing intermittently degrades" blocker — delegation is restored.

## BBGV — Key Decisions & Lessons

### Product clarifications Troy corrected (add to tacit knowledge):
- **Valuations ARE the product.** Don't suggest giving them away as a lead magnet.
- **Collection estimator already exists** in the BBGV backend. Don't rebuild it.
- **ICO pays similar to dealer trade-in.** The differentiator is NOT price — it's convenience, fairness (transparent %), and no pressure. Never pitch ICO as "we pay more."
- **Inheritor ICP is too niche** (~3-5% of TAM, episodic). Mass market = used gun buyers + sellers.
- **GunStreamer needs buyers more than FFLs right now.**

### Lead Magnet Architecture — Final Direction
After several rounds of iteration (inheritor guide → collection estimator → trade-in gap → quiz), landed on:

**"What's This Gun Worth Right Now?"** — two-sided free valuation tool
- Buyers: "Is this price fair?" → market range → stay in ecosystem → future seller
- Sellers: "What can I get?" → market range → InstaCash offer → consignment fallback
- Email gate before showing result
- One routing question: "Are you buying or selling?"
- Cycle architecture: non-converters re-enter nurture, buyers generate testimonials fed back into landing page

**3 sub-agents spawned and completed:**
1. `bbgv-system-architecture` → full Klaviyo flows, conversion paths, feedback loop design
2. `bbgv-copy-sequences` → all landing page + email copy (10 emails total, paste-ready)
3. `bbgv-technical-spec` → Next.js build spec, Laravel API requirements, deployment checklist

**Files saved to Obsidian:** `Projects/BBGV/Lead-Magnet-Engine/` (3 files, ~120KB total)

**Still needed from Troy:**
- Klaviyo API key / list ID for lead capture
- Does BBGV have an existing valuation API endpoint, or do we build the lookup layer?
- Subdomain decision (e.g. value.bluebookofgunvalues.com)

---

## Doctrine Updates (Major)

### 1. Engines vs. Boulders
Ingested from Troy's image. Added to AGENTS.md + SOUL.md as hard decision filter. Every system evaluated: is this a boulder (linear, requires constant push) or an engine (builds momentum, compounds)?

### 2. Cycles Not Funnels (Justin Brooke article, Feb 23 2026)
Full article ingested. Core insight: funnels are designed to lose people. Cycles keep non-buyers in the loop and use buyer data to fuel the next cycle. 5-part cycle: Acquire → Educate → Convert → Collect Feedback → Optimize → repeat.
- Added to AGENTS.md as "Cycles, Not Funnels" doctrine section
- Added Cycle Test to SOUL.md
- Full article distilled to `learnings/cycles-not-funnels-justin-brooke-2026.md`

---

## Memory System Restructure

Implemented 3-layer memory architecture (from Troy's agent ops best practices):
- **Layer 1:** `memory/knowledge-graph.md` — structured facts about projects, people, tools
- **Layer 2:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily notes (this file)
- **Layer 3:** `memory/tacit-knowledge.md` — preferences, patterns, corrections

AGENTS.md updated to reference all 3 layers.

---

## Obsidian-First Rule (Hard Rule — Corrected Today)

Troy explicitly corrected me for not opening files in Obsidian immediately after producing them. This is now a hard rule in:
- AGENTS.md (with exact `open` command template)
- TOOLS.md (vault path + open command as quick reference)
- MEMORY.md (persists across sessions)
- `memory/tacit-knowledge.md`

**Vault:** `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/`
**Projects:** `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/<ProjectName>/`
**Rule:** Write directly to vault → open immediately → tell Troy the path. Never skip.

## 2026 Tech Marketing Playbook — Applied

Sub-agent produced full application of the playbook to all 3 projects:

**BBGV → Thought Leader** (Knowledge + Access advantages)
**Rentagun → Viral Operator** (Access + Personality advantages)
**GunStreamer → Viral Operator** (pre-launch, engineer the announcement)

Saved to `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/2026-Marketing-Playbook-Applied.md`
~1,700 lines: 100+ content ideas per project, viral moment engineering, 90-day plans, cross-project flywheel.

---

## Agent Ops Best Practices (From Troy)

1. 3-layer memory system ✅ (implemented today)
2. Bot gets own accounts — X/Twitter, GitHub, email, Stripe (Troy action item, not done yet)
3. Remove bottleneck protocol — every time J asks Troy to do something, ask "how do we remove this?"
4. Telegram per-project group chats — Troy to decide if worth migrating from WhatsApp
5. Cron jobs = proactive bot — expand aggressively beyond current 7

---

## Misc

- Teams meeting recording: Troy didn't have the right M365 license for built-in recording. Directed to `Cmd+Shift+5` macOS screen recording as fallback.
- Context this session was getting long (200k token limit) — note for future: key context is in knowledge-graph.md, tacit-knowledge.md, and BRAIN.md.

## Open Blockers / Carry Forward

- [ ] Troy to provide Klaviyo API key + list ID for BBGV lead magnet build
- [ ] Confirm BBGV valuation API endpoint availability (or build fallback)
- [ ] Confirm subdomain for lead magnet tool
- [ ] Troy to set up J's own accounts (X, GitHub, email)
- [ ] Troy to decide on Telegram per-project migration
- [ ] Rentagun + GunStreamer: apply lead magnet thinking (defer until BBGV is live)

## Afternoon Session (3:37 PM – 4:43 PM)

### 2026 Tech Marketing Playbook — Applied

Troy shared a "2026 Tech Marketing Playbook" image with 5 steps (Operating Model, Competitive Advantage, Audiences, 100+ Content Ideas, Non-Negotiable Actions). Applied to all 3 projects:

- **BBGV → Thought Leader** (Knowledge + Access: 45-year unique dataset)
- **Rentagun → Viral Operator** (engineer moments, not volume)
- **GunStreamer → Viral Operator** (pre-launch = one big announcement)

Sub-agent produced full document: `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/2026-Marketing-Playbook-Applied.md`
~1,700 lines: 100+ content ideas per project, viral moment engineering, 90-day plans, cross-project flywheel. Opened in Obsidian.

### OutdoorInfluencers.io — New 4th Project

Troy shared business foundation doc. Full plan ingested. Key details:

- **What:** Marketplace + mastermind connecting outdoor creators (hunting/fishing/shooting, 1K–50K followers) with brands
- **Powered by:** BBGV + Rentagun + GunStreamer as anchor brands
- **Core promise:** Creator earns first $500 in 14 days
- **Dominant lever:** Distribution (creators bring their own audiences)
- **Revenue:** Free → Pro ($29-49/mo) → Mastermind ($97-197/mo) + 10-15% transaction fee
- **Doc's self-score:** 420/500 — "Execute immediately"
- **Status:** Started in Claude co-work, Troy wants J's involvement

Two sub-agents spawned:
1. `oi-critical-review` → Critical Review saved to Obsidian
2. `oi-execution-plan` → Execution Plan saved to Obsidian

**Critical review revised score: 310/500** (down from 420). Key findings:
- The $500-in-14-days math doesn't work via affiliate alone for small creators — needs BBGV to pay a flat content fee (~$200-300/creator) instead
- GunStreamer is pre-launch — cannot be a promised income path for Day-14 creators (credibility landmine)
- Bandwidth risk: 4 businesses at critical stages simultaneously is the #1 kill risk
- Platform/payment processor deplatforming is existential if it hits at wrong time
- Niche conflation (fishing + hunting + shooting) needs internal brand segmentation

**Key execution insight from agents:**
Pitch BBGV a 10-creator branded content deal for $2,500 total (flat fee per creator, not affiliate). BBGV says yes easily — cheap for a 180K-list company. This is what makes the 14-day proof achievable.

**J's open question to Troy (unanswered):** Is OutdoorInfluencers the engine that FEEDS BBGV/Rentagun/GunStreamer (brilliant), or does it cannibalize Troy's attention from them (doom loop)? This framing matters for prioritization.

Files saved:
- `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/OutdoorInfluencers/Critical-Review.md`
- `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/OutdoorInfluencers/Execution-Plan.md`
- Original .docx also saved to vault

## Evening Session (4:43 PM – 5:09 PM)

### OutdoorInfluencers.io — Full File Review

Files found at iCloud Obsidian vault: `/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Work/Projects/Outdoor Influencers/`

Extracted tar.gz vault — 10 files read across Marketing/ and Ops/.

**Revised assessment after seeing full files: ~370/500 (up from critical agent's 310/500)**

**What's production-ready:**
- Landing page HTML (841 lines, full CSS, correct branding) — can go live today
- Campaign briefs (BBGV/Rentagun/GunStreamer) — stacked flat fees solve the $500 math: BBGV $500 + Rentagun $300 + GunStreamer $200 = $1,000 conservative in 14 days
- Email sequence — all 5 emails written, branching logic, A/B tests planned

**Two must-fix before touching creators:**
1. **Email 4 proof data is fabricated** ([Creator A] $520, [Creator B] $1,850 etc.) — FTC risk + trust killer. Fix: label as "projected examples" OR hold until Cohort 1 produces real data. Run Cohort 1 with emails 1-3 only.
2. **GunStreamer is pre-launch** — Campaign Brief #3 promises live streaming revenue on Day 8-10 of sprint. Platform isn't live. Fix: Drop GunStreamer from Sprint Cohort 1, run BBGV + Rentagun only ($800 conservative still beats $500 promise). Re-add GunStreamer when platform launches.

**Two infra items needed before Week 1:**
- BBGV + Rentagun affiliate tracking doesn't exist yet — must build before sprint creators get links
- ConvertKit vs Klaviyo decision — Troy already on Klaviyo, no reason for second ESP

**Key file locations (iCloud vault):**
- `OutdoorInfluencers-LandingPage.html` — deploy to outdoorinfluencers.io
- `OutdoorInfluencers-Monetization-Playbook.pdf` — 28KB, lead magnet PDF exists
- `Projects/OutdoorInfluencers/Marketing/` — ICP, Brand Voice, Email Sequences, Campaign Briefs, Lead Magnet, Website Architecture
- `Projects/OutdoorInfluencers/Ops/` — 90-Day Roadmap, Revenue Model, Ecosystem Integration
