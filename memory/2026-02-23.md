# Daily Notes — 2026-02-23 (Monday)

## Infrastructure Fixes

**Gateway LaunchAgent was broken (resolved)**
- Root cause: plist missing `gateway` subcommand + pending device re-approval after reinstall
- Fix: `openclaw gateway install --force` → `openclaw gateway restart` → `openclaw devices approve <id>`
- Sub-agent spawn now confirmed healthy (hourly preflight checks passing all day)
- Logged in `mission-control/ops-log.md`

**WhatsApp gateway** had two brief disconnects (status 499) — self-healed in ~3 seconds both times, no action needed.

**BRAIN.md updated:** removed stale "subagent pairing intermittently degrades" blocker — delegation is restored.

## BBGV — Key Decisions & Lessons

### Product clarifications Troy corrected (add to tacit knowledge):
- **Valuations ARE the product.** Don't suggest giving them away as a lead magnet.
- **Collection estimator already exists** in the BBGV backend. Don't rebuild it.
- **ICO pays similar to dealer trade-in.** The differentiator is NOT price — it's convenience, fairness (transparent %), and no pressure. Never pitch ICO as "we pay more."
- **Inheritor ICP is too niche** (~3-5% of TAM, episodic). Mass market = used gun buyers + sellers.
- **GunStreamer needs buyers more than FFLs right now.**

### Lead Magnet Architecture — Final Direction
After several rounds of iteration (inheritor guide → collection estimator → trade-in gap → quiz), landed on:

**"What's This Gun Worth Right Now?"** — two-sided free valuation tool
- Buyers: "Is this price fair?" → market range → stay in ecosystem → future seller
- Sellers: "What can I get?" → market range → InstaCash offer → consignment fallback
- Email gate before showing result
- One routing question: "Are you buying or selling?"
- Cycle architecture: non-converters re-enter nurture, buyers generate testimonials fed back into landing page

**3 sub-agents spawned and completed:**
1. `bbgv-system-architecture` → full Klaviyo flows, conversion paths, feedback loop design
2. `bbgv-copy-sequences` → all landing page + email copy (10 emails total, paste-ready)
3. `bbgv-technical-spec` → Next.js build spec, Laravel API requirements, deployment checklist

**Files saved to Obsidian:** `Projects/BBGV/Lead-Magnet-Engine/` (3 files, ~120KB total)

**Still needed from Troy:**
- Klaviyo API key / list ID for lead capture
- Does BBGV have an existing valuation API endpoint, or do we build the lookup layer?
- Subdomain decision (e.g. value.bluebookofgunvalues.com)

## Doctrine Updates (Major)

### 1. Engines vs. Boulders
Ingested from Troy's image. Added to AGENTS.md + SOUL.md as hard decision filter. Every system evaluated: is this a boulder (linear, requires constant push) or an engine (builds momentum, compounds)?

### 2. Cycles Not Funnels (Justin Brooke article, Feb 23 2026)
Full article ingested. Core insight: funnels are designed to lose people. Cycles keep non-buyers in the loop and use buyer data to fuel the next cycle. 5-part cycle: Acquire → Educate → Convert → Collect Feedback → Optimize → repeat.
- Added to AGENTS.md as "Cycles, Not Funnels" doctrine section
- Added Cycle Test to SOUL.md
- Full article distilled to `learnings/cycles-not-funnels-justin-brooke-2026.md`

## Memory System Restructure

Implemented 3-layer memory architecture (from Troy's agent ops best practices):
- **Layer 1:** `memory/knowledge-graph.md` — structured facts about projects, people, tools
- **Layer 2:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily notes (this file)
- **Layer 3:** `memory/tacit-knowledge.md` — preferences, patterns, corrections

AGENTS.md updated to reference all 3 layers.

## Obsidian-First Rule (Hard Rule — Corrected Today)

Troy explicitly corrected me for not opening files in Obsidian immediately after producing them. This is now a hard rule in:
- AGENTS.md (with exact `open` command template)
- TOOLS.md (vault path + open command as quick reference)
- MEMORY.md (persists across sessions)
- `memory/tacit-knowledge.md`

**Vault:** `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/`
**Projects:** `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/<ProjectName>/`
**Rule:** Write directly to vault → open immediately → tell Troy the path. Never skip.

## 2026 Tech Marketing Playbook — Applied

Sub-agent produced full application of the playbook to all 3 projects:

**BBGV → Thought Leader** (Knowledge + Access advantages)
**Rentagun → Viral Operator** (Access + Personality advantages)
**GunStreamer → Viral Operator** (pre-launch, engineer the announcement)

Saved to `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/2026-Marketing-Playbook-Applied.md`
~1,700 lines: 100+ content ideas per project, viral moment engineering, 90-day plans, cross-project flywheel.

---

## Agent Ops Best Practices (From Troy)

1. 3-layer memory system ✅ (implemented today)
2. Bot gets own accounts — X/Twitter, GitHub, email, Stripe (Troy action item, not done yet)
3. Remove bottleneck protocol — every time J asks Troy to do something, ask "how do we remove this?"
4. Telegram per-project group chats — Troy to decide if worth migrating from WhatsApp
5. Cron jobs = proactive bot — expand aggressively beyond current 7

---

## Misc

- Teams meeting recording: Troy didn't have the right M365 license for built-in recording. Directed to `Cmd+Shift+5` macOS screen recording as fallback.
- Context this session was getting long (200k token limit) — note for future: key context is in knowledge-graph.md, tacit-knowledge.md, and BRAIN.md.

## Open Blockers / Carry Forward

- [ ] Troy to provide Klaviyo API key + list ID for BBGV lead magnet build
- [ ] Confirm BBGV valuation API endpoint availability (or build fallback)
- [ ] Confirm subdomain for lead magnet tool
- [ ] Troy to set up J's own accounts (X, GitHub, email)
- [ ] Troy to decide on Telegram per-project migration
- [ ] Rentagun + GunStreamer: apply lead magnet thinking (defer until BBGV is live)
