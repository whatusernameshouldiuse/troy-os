# Daily Notes — 2026-02-23 (Monday)

---

## Infrastructure Fixes

**Gateway LaunchAgent was broken (resolved)**
- Root cause: plist missing `gateway` subcommand + pending device re-approval after reinstall
- Fix: `openclaw gateway install --force` → `openclaw gateway restart` → `openclaw devices approve <id>`
- Sub-agent spawn now confirmed healthy (hourly preflight checks passing all day)
- Logged in `mission-control/ops-log.md`

**WhatsApp gateway** had two brief disconnects (status 499) — self-healed in ~3 seconds both times, no action needed.

**BRAIN.md updated:** removed stale "subagent pairing intermittently degrades" blocker — delegation is restored.

---

## BBGV — Key Decisions & Lessons

### Product clarifications Troy corrected (add to tacit knowledge):
- **Valuations ARE the product.** Don't suggest giving them away as a lead magnet.
- **Collection estimator already exists** in the BBGV backend. Don't rebuild it.
- **ICO pays similar to dealer trade-in.** The differentiator is NOT price — it's convenience, fairness (transparent %), and no pressure. Never pitch ICO as "we pay more."
- **Inheritor ICP is too niche** (~3-5% of TAM, episodic). Mass market = used gun buyers + sellers.
- **GunStreamer needs buyers more than FFLs right now.**

### Lead Magnet Architecture — Final Direction
After several rounds of iteration (inheritor guide → collection estimator → trade-in gap → quiz), landed on:

**"What's This Gun Worth Right Now?"** — two-sided free valuation tool
- Buyers: "Is this price fair?" → market range → stay in ecosystem → future seller
- Sellers: "What can I get?" → market range → InstaCash offer → consignment fallback
- Email gate before showing result
- One routing question: "Are you buying or selling?"
- Cycle architecture: non-converters re-enter nurture, buyers generate testimonials fed back into landing page

**3 sub-agents spawned and completed:**
1. `bbgv-system-architecture` → full Klaviyo flows, conversion paths, feedback loop design
2. `bbgv-copy-sequences` → all landing page + email copy (10 emails total, paste-ready)
3. `bbgv-technical-spec` → Next.js build spec, Laravel API requirements, deployment checklist

**Files saved to Obsidian:** `Projects/BBGV/Lead-Magnet-Engine/` (3 files, ~120KB total)

**Still needed from Troy:**
- Klaviyo API key / list ID for lead capture
- Does BBGV have an existing valuation API endpoint, or do we build the lookup layer?
- Subdomain decision (e.g. value.bluebookofgunvalues.com)

---

## Doctrine Updates (Major)

### 1. Engines vs. Boulders
Ingested from Troy's image. Added to AGENTS.md + SOUL.md as hard decision filter. Every system evaluated: is this a boulder (linear, requires constant push) or an engine (builds momentum, compounds)?

### 2. Cycles Not Funnels (Justin Brooke article, Feb 23 2026)
Full article ingested. Core insight: funnels are designed to lose people. Cycles keep non-buyers in the loop and use buyer data to fuel the next cycle. 5-part cycle: Acquire → Educate → Convert → Collect Feedback → Optimize → repeat.
- Added to AGENTS.md as "Cycles, Not Funnels" doctrine section
- Added Cycle Test to SOUL.md
- Full article distilled to `learnings/cycles-not-funnels-justin-brooke-2026.md`

---

## Memory System Restructure

Implemented 3-layer memory architecture (from Troy's agent ops best practices):
- **Layer 1:** `memory/knowledge-graph.md` — structured facts about projects, people, tools
- **Layer 2:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily notes (this file)
- **Layer 3:** `memory/tacit-knowledge.md` — preferences, patterns, corrections

AGENTS.md updated to reference all 3 layers.

---

## Obsidian-First Rule (Hard Rule — Corrected Today)

Troy explicitly corrected me for not opening files in Obsidian immediately after producing them. This is now a hard rule in:
- AGENTS.md (with exact `open` command template)
- TOOLS.md (vault path + open command as quick reference)
- MEMORY.md (persists across sessions)
- `memory/tacit-knowledge.md`

**Vault:** `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/`
**Projects:** `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/<ProjectName>/`
**Rule:** Write directly to vault → open immediately → tell Troy the path. Never skip.

## 2026 Tech Marketing Playbook — Applied

Sub-agent produced full application of the playbook to all 3 projects:

**BBGV → Thought Leader** (Knowledge + Access advantages)
**Rentagun → Viral Operator** (Access + Personality advantages)
**GunStreamer → Viral Operator** (pre-launch, engineer the announcement)

Saved to `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/2026-Marketing-Playbook-Applied.md`
~1,700 lines: 100+ content ideas per project, viral moment engineering, 90-day plans, cross-project flywheel.

---

## Agent Ops Best Practices (From Troy)

1. 3-layer memory system ✅ (implemented today)
2. Bot gets own accounts — X/Twitter, GitHub, email, Stripe (Troy action item, not done yet)
3. Remove bottleneck protocol — every time J asks Troy to do something, ask "how do we remove this?"
4. Telegram per-project group chats — Troy to decide if worth migrating from WhatsApp
5. Cron jobs = proactive bot — expand aggressively beyond current 7

---

## Misc

- Teams meeting recording: Troy didn't have the right M365 license for built-in recording. Directed to `Cmd+Shift+5` macOS screen recording as fallback.
- Context this session was getting long (200k token limit) — note for future: key context is in knowledge-graph.md, tacit-knowledge.md, and BRAIN.md.

---

## Open Blockers / Carry Forward

- [ ] Troy to provide Klaviyo API key + list ID for BBGV lead magnet build
- [ ] Confirm BBGV valuation API endpoint availability (or build fallback)
- [ ] Confirm subdomain for lead magnet tool
- [ ] Troy to set up J's own accounts (X, GitHub, email)
- [ ] Troy to decide on Telegram per-project migration
- [ ] Rentagun + GunStreamer: apply lead magnet thinking (defer until BBGV is live)

---

## Afternoon Session (3:37 PM – 4:43 PM)

### 2026 Tech Marketing Playbook — Applied

Troy shared a "2026 Tech Marketing Playbook" image with 5 steps (Operating Model, Competitive Advantage, Audiences, 100+ Content Ideas, Non-Negotiable Actions). Applied to all 3 projects:

- **BBGV → Thought Leader** (Knowledge + Access: 45-year unique dataset)
- **Rentagun → Viral Operator** (engineer moments, not volume)
- **GunStreamer → Viral Operator** (pre-launch = one big announcement)

Sub-agent produced full document: `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/2026-Marketing-Playbook-Applied.md`
~1,700 lines: 100+ content ideas per project, viral moment engineering, 90-day plans, cross-project flywheel. Opened in Obsidian.

---

### OutdoorInfluencers.io — New 4th Project

Troy shared business foundation doc. Full plan ingested. Key details:

- **What:** Marketplace + mastermind connecting outdoor creators (hunting/fishing/shooting, 1K–50K followers) with brands
- **Powered by:** BBGV + Rentagun + GunStreamer as anchor brands
- **Core promise:** Creator earns first $500 in 14 days
- **Dominant lever:** Distribution (creators bring their own audiences)
- **Revenue:** Free → Pro ($29-49/mo) → Mastermind ($97-197/mo) + 10-15% transaction fee
- **Doc's self-score:** 420/500 — "Execute immediately"
- **Status:** Started in Claude co-work, Troy wants J's involvement

Two sub-agents spawned:
1. `oi-critical-review` → Critical Review saved to Obsidian
2. `oi-execution-plan` → Execution Plan saved to Obsidian

**Critical review revised score: 310/500** (down from 420). Key findings:
- The $500-in-14-days math doesn't work via affiliate alone for small creators — needs BBGV to pay a flat content fee (~$200-300/creator) instead
- GunStreamer is pre-launch — cannot be a promised income path for Day-14 creators (credibility landmine)
- Bandwidth risk: 4 businesses at critical stages simultaneously is the #1 kill risk
- Platform/payment processor deplatforming is existential if it hits at wrong time
- Niche conflation (fishing + hunting + shooting) needs internal brand segmentation

**Key execution insight from agents:**
Pitch BBGV a 10-creator branded content deal for $2,500 total (flat fee per creator, not affiliate). BBGV says yes easily — cheap for a 180K-list company. This is what makes the 14-day proof achievable.

**J's open question to Troy (unanswered):** Is OutdoorInfluencers the engine that FEEDS BBGV/Rentagun/GunStreamer (brilliant), or does it cannibalize Troy's attention from them (doom loop)? This framing matters for prioritization.

Files saved:
- `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/OutdoorInfluencers/Critical-Review.md`
- `~/Documents/Obsidian/Work/Projects/OutdoorInfluencers/Execution-Plan.md`
- Original .docx also saved to vault

---

## Evening Session (4:43 PM – 5:09 PM)

### OutdoorInfluencers.io — Full File Review

Files found at iCloud Obsidian vault: `/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Work/Projects/Outdoor Influencers/`

Extracted tar.gz vault — 10 files read across Marketing/ and Ops/.

**Revised assessment after seeing full files: ~370/500 (up from critical agent's 310/500)**

**What's production-ready:**
- Landing page HTML (841 lines, full CSS, correct branding) — can go live today
- Campaign briefs (BBGV/Rentagun/GunStreamer) — stacked flat fees solve the $500 math: BBGV $500 + Rentagun $300 + GunStreamer $200 = $1,000 conservative in 14 days
- Email sequence — all 5 emails written, branching logic, A/B tests planned

**Two must-fix before touching creators:**
1. **Email 4 proof data is fabricated** ([Creator A] $520, [Creator B] $1,850 etc.) — FTC risk + trust killer. Fix: label as "projected examples" OR hold until Cohort 1 produces real data. Run Cohort 1 with emails 1-3 only.
2. **GunStreamer is pre-launch** — Campaign Brief #3 promises live streaming revenue on Day 8-10 of sprint. Platform isn't live. Fix: Drop GunStreamer from Sprint Cohort 1, run BBGV + Rentagun only ($800 conservative still beats $500 promise). Re-add GunStreamer when platform launches.

**Two infra items needed before Week 1:**
- BBGV + Rentagun affiliate tracking doesn't exist yet — must build before sprint creators get links
- ConvertKit vs Klaviyo decision — Troy already on Klaviyo, no reason for second ESP

**Key file locations (iCloud vault):**
- `OutdoorInfluencers-LandingPage.html` — deploy to outdoorinfluencers.io
- `OutdoorInfluencers-Monetization-Playbook.pdf` — 28KB, lead magnet PDF exists
- `Projects/OutdoorInfluencers/Marketing/` — ICP, Brand Voice, Email Sequences, Campaign Briefs, Lead Magnet, Website Architecture
- `Projects/OutdoorInfluencers/Ops/` — 90-Day Roadmap, Revenue Model, Ecosystem Integration

---

## Late Afternoon / Evening Session (5:09 PM – 6:20 PM)

### Marketing Operating System — Fully Assembled

Applied Corey Haines' Marketing OS blueprint to our stack. Gap analysis:
- Brain ✅ (AGENTS.md + project CLAUDE.md files)
- Skills ✅ (35 installed, exceeds his 14)
- Brand context ✅ (product-marketing-context.md all 4 projects)
- Agents ✅ (sub-agent spawning restored)
- MCPs/tools ⚠️ (missing YouTube transcript, outlier tracker, Reddit RSS)
- Per-project learnings files ⚠️ (have global tacit-knowledge.md, not per-project)
- Skills feeding skills ⚠️ (independent, no output→input pipeline yet)

Article saved to `learnings/marketing-os-blueprint-corey-haines.md`.

CLAUDE.md written for all 4 projects with: read context → pick skill → execute to draft-ready → write to Obsidian. Marketing OS is operational.

---

### agent-browser — Installed and Active

- Installed globally: `npm install -g agent-browser`
- Chromium downloaded via `agent-browser install`
- **OpenClaw Chrome extension browser tool DISABLED** (`browser.enabled: false` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`)
- Gateway restarted, confirmed working
- Test: opened rentagun.com, full interactive snapshot in <3s
- TOOLS.md updated with full command reference
- `tacit-knowledge.md` and `BRAIN.md` need update: stale "browser relay unreliable" note — relay intentionally replaced

---

### Rentagun CRO Audit (Live)

Used agent-browser to crawl homepage, how-it-works, product pages, my-account. Key findings:

**Critical:**
- `/subscriptions/` = 404 — pricing page doesn't exist at obvious URL
- Primary hero CTA "Rent Your Gun" → product catalog, NOT subscribe (wrong for subscription business)
- Daily pricing displayed on product cards ($11/day, $64/day) — confuses subscription vs. transactional model
- Signup = bare WooCommerce My Account form, zero selling copy

**High impact:**
- Quiz absent from main conversion path (Troy has tried to build multiple times, never stuck)
- "START YOUR JOURNEY" links to how-it-works anchor, not subscribe
- Zero real subscriber testimonials visible
- Mixed model signals throughout (e-commerce UX vs subscription product)

Skills applied: page-cro + signup-flow-cro (fetched from Corey's GitHub)

**4 questions sent to Troy before building quiz:**
1. What broke with RevenueHunt? (Technical / low completion / completed but didn't convert?)
2. Where does "Get Basic Access" actually lead? (Existing subscribe flow?)
3. Quiz output: specific gun recommendations OR tier recommendation?
4. Build platform: WordPress shortcode, Typeform embed, or Next.js on Vercel?

**Awaiting Troy's answers before proceeding.**

---

### BRAIN.md Updates Needed (flagged at heartbeat)
- Remove stale "Browser relay attach remains unreliable" — relay intentionally disabled, replaced with agent-browser
- Update OpenClaw update note: v2026.2.22-2 available

---

## Evening Session cont. (6:20 PM – 6:50 PM)

### OutdoorInfluencers — Cold Outreach System Built

Troy requested a top 0.1% cold outreach system for creator recruitment. Read all OI.io vault docs (ICP, Campaign Briefs, Brand Voice, Email Sequences, 90-Day Roadmap). Applied cold-email skill from Corey Haines' marketingskills-plugin (found IN the OI vault). 

Sub-agent produced 5 files in `Projects/OutdoorInfluencers/Cold-Outreach-System/`:
- `Email-Sequences.md` — 15 complete emails, 5-email sequences × 3 segments (Frustrated YouTuber, Weekend Warrior, Aspiring Pro). Full subject, preview, body copy.
- `DM-Scripts.md` — Instagram + YouTube DMs per segment, follow-up DMs, response-handling matrix
- `List-Building-Playbook.md` — YouTube search strings, Instagram scraping (Phantombuster), Reddit targeting, qualification checklist, Tier 1/2/3 matrix
- `Tool-Setup-Guide.md` — Instantly.ai setup, sending domain DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), warm-up schedule, Airtable CRM schema, J's daily workflow
- `Launch-Checklist.md` — Phase 0 today, 5-phase rollout, 30-day benchmarks

**Critical: Email warm-up (Phase 0) must start TODAY** — 14-day lead time before cold emails can fire.
**DM outreach can start immediately** — no warm-up needed.

**Credentials still needed from Troy:**
- [ ] Instantly.ai account + API key
- [ ] Cold outreach sending domain (new domain, NOT outdoorinfluencers.io)
- [ ] Hunter.io or Apollo.io account + API key
- [ ] OutdoorInfluencers Instagram account for DM sequences

Troy has not yet confirmed which tools he has. Awaiting response.

---

## Updated Open Blockers / Carry Forward (Full List)

**BBGV:**
- [ ] Klaviyo API key + list ID for lead magnet build
- [ ] Confirm valuation API endpoint or build fallback
- [ ] Subdomain for lead magnet tool (e.g. value.bluebookofgunvalues.com)

**OutdoorInfluencers.io:**
- [ ] Fix Email 4 proof data (label as projected or hold until Cohort 1 real data)
- [ ] Decision: drop GunStreamer from Sprint Cohort 1 until platform launches
- [ ] Build BBGV + Rentagun affiliate tracking (before sprint creators onboard)
- [ ] ConvertKit vs Klaviyo decision for OI.io email
- [ ] Deploy landing page HTML to outdoorinfluencers.io
- [ ] Domain registered? Hosting configured for outdoorinfluencers.io?

**OutdoorInfluencers — Outreach System stack DECIDED:**
- **Instantly.ai rejected** — Troy wants OpenClaw-maxed approach
- **Stack: Snov.io ($30/mo) + n8n (already have) + Resend (free tier) + Airtable**
- Snov.io = email finding + verification + drip campaigns in one tool, full CLI in skills toolkit
- n8n = orchestration (daily lead add → sequence trigger → reply log → Airtable)
- J operates entire pipeline via CLI + cron jobs
- Total cost: $30/month (vs $37 Instantly + $34 Hunter = $71)

**Still needed from Troy:**
- [ ] Snov.io account (client_id + client_secret from snov.io/integration/api)
- [ ] Cold outreach sending domain (new, separate from outdoorinfluencers.io)
- [ ] OI.io Instagram account for DM sequences (can start tonight)

**Infrastructure:**
- [ ] Troy to set up J's own accounts (X, GitHub, email)
- [ ] Troy to decide on Telegram per-project migration
- [ ] openclaw update available (v2026.2.22-2) — run `openclaw update` when convenient

---

## Social Media Outreach — Platform Assessment (6:53 PM)

- **YouTube**: Best channel. Email from About tab → J scrapes with agent-browser → feeds Snov.io sequence. Troy approved scraping first 50-100 creators (awaiting go-ahead).
- **Instagram DMs**: Works but ~50-100/day limit, no safe automation. J drafts daily batch → Troy sends manually (15 min/day). Need OI.io Instagram account.
- **TikTok**: Cold DMs not viable (mutual follow required). Strategy: follow → engage → follow-back → DM. Long game.
- **Highest leverage starting action**: YouTube email scrape + Instagram daily draft batch
