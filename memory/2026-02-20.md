## System Order + Operating Upgrades
- Completed major workspace and Obsidian vault normalization:
  - canonical top-level structure
  - Projects cleanup and canonical naming
  - migration logs + indexes
- Implemented co-founder operating doctrine and mapped doctrine focus into each core agent file.
- Upgraded heartbeat behavior to avoid churn and only act on material changes.
- Added Obsidian performance mitigation (`.obsidianignore`) to reduce freezing from heavy build/indexed folders.

## Ops Hardening Implemented
- Added mission-control control files:
  - AGENT-OPS-PREFLIGHT.md
  - MODEL-ROUTING-MATRIX.md
  - PROJECT-INTAKE-TEMPLATE.md
  - MEMORY-MAINTENANCE-RUNBOOK.md
  - SKILL-BUILDER-TRIGGER.md
  - DELEGATION-FALLBACK-POLICY.md
  - ops-log.md
- Wired these into doctrine + heartbeat daytime preflight check.

## Key Lessons (Compounding)
- Non-destructive structural changes with migration logs preserve trust and speed.
- Delegation reliability must be treated as an operational dependency (preflight + fallback), not an assumption.
- Project-local `CLAUDE.md` context significantly improves usability for non-technical workflows.
- For promo execution speed, high-quality static/image posts can outperform rushed AI video when source audio is unavailable.
