# Daily Notes — 2026-02-24

## Summary
Heavy execution day. Analytics pulled, GunStreamer docs corrected, homepage prototype built, social strategy written, Slack partially configured.

## Analytics Work

### Klaviyo (BBGV account) — live API pull
- API key confirmed in env: `KLAVIYO_API_KEY` (pk_9ce...)
- 20 lists total. GunStreamer: **120,320 contacts** across 14 wave/batch lists — **zero emails sent to most of them**
- BBGV warm-up: Batch 001 = 40,374 profiles; Batch 002 = 1,999 profiles
- Newsletter subscribers 10/14 (RGdGjP): 0 profiles — likely archived/migrated
- Engaged Re-engaged (T8cw5C): 0 profiles — may be empty
- Consignment Leads (Vm8nsG): 0
- Blog Subscribers (WUV3Yf): 0
- **CRITICAL: Zero active flows.** One welcome series stuck in draft since Aug 2024.
- 8 campaigns sent all time. Last BBGV send: Jan 29 (26+ days ago). List going cold.
- Reporting API gave inflated numbers — actual stats from Klaviyo UI: 21.03% opens, 2,064 recipients for Saturday Night Special send (not 38%/10K as API reported). API issue logged as a data quality lesson.
- Segments exist: Engaged-30, Engaged-90, At Risk, Inactive — none connected to flows.

### Google Search Console
- **BBGV:** 389K clicks, 13M impressions over 3 months. **Traffic down 29%** (228K→161K clicks, first 6wks vs last 6wks). Could be seasonal (holiday baseline) or algo hit. Needs GA4 to diagnose.
  - "true gun value" competitor: 61K impressions, 0.86% CTR — massive leak
  - Login page ranks #3 on Google (878 clicks/mo) — freemium transition will fix this
  - Position 5-12 on dozens of gun model queries with 5-10K impressions each — CTR optimization opportunity
- **Rentagun:** 173 total clicks in 3 months. 100% branded. "rent a gun" at position 19 with 6 impressions. Zero non-branded SEO footprint.

### Deliverable
- Full snapshot saved: `Projects/Analytics/Multi-Project-Analytics-Snapshot-2026-02-24.md`
- Klaviyo-specific: `Projects/Analytics/Klaviyo-Analytics-Snapshot-2026-02-24.md`

## GunStreamer — Major Status Update
- **Platform is now LIVE** — not pre-launch. BRAIN.md and knowledge-graph.md updated.
- Homepage is a blank app embed ("No live or upcoming streams right now"). All marketing lives at /dealercontact.
- /dealercontact: full FFL landing page with all branding, copy, pricing, compliance.
- /forbuyers: full buyer landing page.
- Branding: deep navy (#0a0e1a), red/coral (#e84444), circular crosshair logo, Oswald + DM Sans fonts.

### Deliverables built today
1. `Projects/GunStreamer/Homepage-Redesign-Brief-2026-02-24.md` — full 9-section homepage architecture
2. `Projects/GunStreamer/homepage-prototype.html` — working HTML prototype, open in browser, has demo toggle for LIVE/OFFLINE widget states
3. `Projects/GunStreamer/Dev-Handoff-Live-Widget.md` — API specs (3 endpoints), React component, Next.js SSR option, embed options, design tokens
4. `Projects/GunStreamer/Social-Media-Strategy-2026-02-24.md` — 5 content pillars, platform breakdown, repurposing system, 2-week launch calendar

### Key design decision
Live stream widget is a **feature within the hero**, not the whole page. Two states: LIVE (embed + viewer count + lot card + Bid Now) and OFFLINE (next show + countdown + replay). Conditionally rendered based on `/api/streams/active` API call with 60s polling or Next.js 30s revalidation.

## AGENTS.md Updated
Added `Marketing Skills Dispatch` section with signal→skill mapping table. Now auto-selects appropriate Corey Haines skill (from ~/clawd/skills/) when Troy raises any marketing topic. 30+ skills mapped to triggers.

---

## Slack Configuration — In Progress
- Bot token staged in config: `xoxb-8973068882337-...`
- User token staged: `xoxp-8973068882337-...`
- **BLOCKED on: App Token (`xapp-...`)** — needed for Socket Mode. Troy needs to get from Slack app settings → Socket Mode → App-Level Tokens.
- Config file updated at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` with Slack entry (appToken placeholder = `__NEEDS_XAPP_TOKEN__`)
- Once xapp token provided: slot in + restart gateway = live on Slack

---

## Blockers (new/updated)
| Item | Project | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Slack xapp token | Infra | Troy needs to get from api.slack.com/apps |
| GA4 access | BBGV | Troy offered to get it — needed to diagnose -29% traffic drop |
| GunStreamer 3 API questions | GunStreamer | What can users DO right now? How were 120K sourced? Primary CTA for Email 1? |

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Klaviyo reporting API vs UI**: The campaign-values-reports API can return inflated/incorrect stats. Always cross-check against the Klaviyo UI when reporting metrics to Troy. Caught because Troy sent a screenshot showing 21% vs my reported 38%.
- **List profile counts**: The `additional-fields[list]=profile_count` API field works but hits rate limits fast at 1 call/list. Need 1-1.2s delays between calls. Rate limit resets in ~30s.
- **List names ≠ actual counts**: GunStreamer wave names ("Wave 7 (10.0K)") did match actual counts (confirmed 10,000), but never assume — always verify.
- **BRAIN.md was stale**: GunStreamer listed as pre-launch when it's live. Keep BRAIN.md updated in real-time.

---

## Decisions Made Today
- GunStreamer back in OI.io Sprint Cohort 1 (platform is live, credibility issue resolved)
- Homepage architecture: dual-audience (buyers + dealers), live widget in hero, not full-page app embed
- Social strategy anchored on stream content repurposing: 1 stream → 10+ pieces
- Slack > Telegram for team channel (Troy already in Slack with team)

---

## Afternoon Session (12:02–12:45 PM)

### Slack Config Fixed
- OpenClaw config had invalid Slack keys (`_troyUserId`, `_troyDmChannel` under `channels.slack`) causing config validation errors on startup.
- Removed both keys, restarted gateway. WhatsApp + Slack both `ON/OK` after.
- Troy Slack IDs saved elsewhere (knowledge-graph.md). They don't belong in openclaw.json.
- **Lesson:** Never store custom metadata under provider config blocks in openclaw.json — use knowledge-graph.md or a separate notes file.

### Slack Security Warning (Active)
- `channels.slack.groupPolicy="open"` is triggering 2 CRITICAL security warnings. With elevated tools enabled, a prompt injection in any Slack channel becomes high-impact.
- Fix: set `groupPolicy="allowlist"` and enumerate allowed channels. Flagged but not yet addressed — Troy hasn't decided which channels should be allowlisted.
- **Blocker:** Need Troy to confirm which Slack channels J should respond in before tightening to allowlist.

### ND Brick Pavers — New Commission Project Added
- Troy wants to run a full marketing system for a local paver contractor in ND.
- Deal: Troy earns commission per closed lead referred.
- Stack: GoHighLevel → Vercel migration, programmatic SEO, GA4 + GSC + FB Pixel, Facebook ads + social, lead gen engine.
- Project intake posted to `#openclaw-seo` Slack channel.
- Obsidian folder created: `Projects/NDBrickPavers/`
- Added to BRAIN.md.
- **Status: Fully blocked on Troy providing assets** — need GoHighLevel URL, GA4 ID, FB page, branding, business context (services, geo, competitors, deal value, commission %).

### Traffic Channels System — New Obsidian Folder
- Created `Projects/TrafficChannels/` as a home for all traffic channel ideas Troy flags.
- System: J logs every idea with status (🔵→🟡→🟢→⚙️→❌), fit assessment, build estimate, dependencies.
- **Weekly cron (Monday 9AM CT)** set up: scans folder, does quick opportunity assessment, updates statuses, notifies Troy if anything is approved.
- First two channels captured:
  1. `newsjacking.md` — news-angle article fast publishing. Best fit: BBGV + GunStreamer. ~1 day build. Blocked on BBGV CMS API access.
  2. `content-pillar-system.md` — 3-5 content pillars run simultaneously, evaluated monthly.

### Content Pillar System — Architecture Sub-Agent Spawned
- Troy wants content pillar system implemented this week across ALL 5 brands.
- Framework: 3-5 pillars per brand = Concept + 1-2 Formats. 5-10 posts/month per pillar. Monthly analytics review → stay / elevate / cycle out.
- Full system doc saved to Obsidian with per-brand pillar proposals, monthly analytics worksheet, and recap template.
- Analysis posted to `#openclaw-ops` in Slack.
- **Architecture sub-agent spawned** (session: content-pillar-architecture) — builds full implementation plan: 4 pillars per brand with specific post angles, platform strategy, calendar templates, AI production pipeline, quick-start content batches. Auto-announces on completion.
- **Monthly cron (1st of month 9AM CT)** added: full pillar analytics review, decisions, recap posted to Troy + #openclaw-ops.
- **Key insight from sub-agent:** GunStreamer's streams are a zero-effort content engine (every stream auto-generates pillar content). BBGV's 180K email list is primary distribution, not social growth. ND Brick Pavers: Google Business Profile is highest-leverage first action above all social.

### BRAIN.md Stale Blocker (Still Active)
- BRAIN.md → BBGV Lead Magnet still says "Await Klaviyo API key + list ID" — Klaviyo API key is already confirmed and in active use since this morning.
- This blocker should be updated to reflect what's actually missing: valuation API endpoint + subdomain decision.

## Decisions Made (Afternoon)
- Content Pillar System: approved for implementation this week across all 5 brands
- ND Brick Pavers: added to portfolio as commission project, intake initiated
- Traffic Channels: new Obsidian system for logging viable traffic strategies; weekly review cadence
- Slack allowlist: deferred — need Troy to confirm which channels before tightening groupPolicy

## Open Blockers (End of Day State)
| Item | Project | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| GoHighLevel URL + export | ND Brick Pavers | Plus GA4 ID, FB page, branding, business context |
| BBGV BRAIN.md stale line | BBGV | "Await Klaviyo API key" — already resolved, needs update |
| Slack groupPolicy allowlist | Infra | Security critical — need Troy to confirm allowed channels |
| GunStreamer Email 1 (3 questions) | GunStreamer | What users can do now / list source / CTA goal |
| GA4 access | BBGV | Needed to diagnose -29% traffic drop |
| Content pillar architecture doc | All brands | Sub-agent running, auto-announces on completion |

## BBGV Email Deliverability — Klaviyo Support Diagnosis (Feb 24 2026)

### Root Cause Confirmed
The **Paid Subscribers list (9,856 members)** was included in multiple campaign sends.
- **7,159 profiles = Not Engaged** (72% of the list)
- 31.65% open rate (past 30 days) — looks okay but is skewed by the engaged minority
- 3.50% click rate
- $0.00 average order value (no Klaviyo revenue tracking connected)

### Klaviyo Support Actions Taken
- Klaviyo support identified the Paid Subscribers list as the primary deliverability drag
- Created an unengaged segment: https://www.klaviyo.com/list/WBbtVg
- Recommendation: suppress the unengaged profiles OR exclude segment from all sends

### Relevant Klaviyo Links
- Campaign deliverability report: https://www.klaviyo.com/campaign/01KJ0P357RJ55E8D1QRXFCX5QF/reports/deliverability
- Paid Subscribers engagement report: https://www.klaviyo.com/list/YjVgTd/reports/engagement
- Unengaged segment (built by support): https://www.klaviyo.com/list/WBbtVg
- List ID: YjVgTd

### J's Recommendation
**Suppress the 7,159 unengaged profiles** (not just exclude). Reasons:
1. Suppressed profiles don't count against billing
2. Exclusions can be accidentally overridden; suppressions are a hard stop
3. Inbox providers track send volume to non-openers — suppressing removes the signal permanently

### Recovery Timeline
- Next send to engaged-only: immediate inbox improvement possible
- Full sender reputation repair: 30–60 days of consistent clean sends

### Immediate Protocol (Do Not Deviate)
1. **Do NOT send to Paid Subscribers list** until cleaned
2. Suppress or exclude segment WBbtVg from all sends now
3. Send only to Engaged-30 or Engaged-90 segments for next 30 days
4. Monitor inbox placement via Klaviyo deliverability tab after each send

## Afternoon Session 2 (14:00–14:22 CST)

### Slack Bot Fixed
- Gateway had stale process (pid 17784) squatting on port 18789, blocking LaunchAgent restarts
- Fixed: killed stale process, clean gateway restart. Both WhatsApp + Slack now ON/OK.
- **requireMention removed globally** for Slack channels — bot now responds to all messages in all channels without needing @mention (Troy confirmed: only bot + Troy in channels)

### BBGV Email Deliverability — Root Cause Confirmed
- Paid Subscribers list (9,856 members) had 7,159 NOT ENGAGED profiles (72%) included in multiple campaign sends
- Klaviyo support confirmed this as the deliverability drag
- Klaviyo support built unengaged segment: `WBbtVg`
- **Hard rule added to BRAIN.md:** Do NOT send to Paid Subscribers list. Engaged-only sends for 30+ days.
- Next step: Troy to approve suppression of 7,159 unengaged profiles
- Recovery timeline: 30–60 days of clean sends
- Relevant links saved to daily notes above

### Rentagun WooCommerce Image Migration
- CSV file received: 159 products, 321 signed images from egunco.corestore.shop
- Signed URLs confirmed still live (200 OK, image/jpeg)
- **Blocked on:** WordPress URL + Application Password to kick off download → upload pipeline
- CSV saved to ~/clawd/rentagun_woocommerce_import.csv

### J's Email Account Created
- Gmail: clawj79@gmail.com (created by Troy)
- **Setup in progress:** Troy running `gog auth add clawj79@gmail.com` to authorize
- Plan: gog auth → forward clawj79 to #openclaw-email Slack channel → J sees all inbound emails
- `gog` already has: support@rentagun.com, troy@bluebookinc.com, troy@gunstreamer.com, troy@rentagun.com

### Sub-Agents Running/Completed
- `bbgv-email-strategy`: ✅ Completed — Email-Strategy-2026-02-24.md + Klaviyo-Dev-Handoff-2026-02-24.md saved to Obsidian/BBGV/
- ND Brick Pavers intake: Slack agent handling in #openclaw-seo (files:read scope gap — Troy re-uploading files directly)

### Blockers Updated
| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| WP URL + App Password for RaG image pipeline | Still blocked |
| gog auth for clawj79@gmail.com | In progress |
| Suppress 7,159 BBGV unengaged profiles | Pending Troy approval |
