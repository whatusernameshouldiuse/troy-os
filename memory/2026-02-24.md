## Analytics Work

### Klaviyo (BBGV account) — live API pull
- API key confirmed in env: `KLAVIYO_API_KEY` (pk_9ce...)
- 20 lists total. GunStreamer: **120,320 contacts** across 14 wave/batch lists — **zero emails sent to most of them**
- BBGV warm-up: Batch 001 = 40,374 profiles; Batch 002 = 1,999 profiles
- Newsletter subscribers 10/14 (RGdGjP): 0 profiles — likely archived/migrated
- Engaged Re-engaged (T8cw5C): 0 profiles — may be empty
- Consignment Leads (Vm8nsG): 0
- Blog Subscribers (WUV3Yf): 0
- **CRITICAL: Zero active flows.** One welcome series stuck in draft since Aug 2024.
- 8 campaigns sent all time. Last BBGV send: Jan 29 (26+ days ago). List going cold.
- Reporting API gave inflated numbers — actual stats from Klaviyo UI: 21.03% opens, 2,064 recipients for Saturday Night Special send (not 38%/10K as API reported). API issue logged as a data quality lesson.
- Segments exist: Engaged-30, Engaged-90, At Risk, Inactive — none connected to flows.

### Google Search Console
- **BBGV:** 389K clicks, 13M impressions over 3 months. **Traffic down 29%** (228K→161K clicks, first 6wks vs last 6wks). Could be seasonal (holiday baseline) or algo hit. Needs GA4 to diagnose.
  - "true gun value" competitor: 61K impressions, 0.86% CTR — massive leak
  - Login page ranks #3 on Google (878 clicks/mo) — freemium transition will fix this
  - Position 5-12 on dozens of gun model queries with 5-10K impressions each — CTR optimization opportunity
- **Rentagun:** 173 total clicks in 3 months. 100% branded. "rent a gun" at position 19 with 6 impressions. Zero non-branded SEO footprint.

### Deliverable
- Full snapshot saved: `Projects/Analytics/Multi-Project-Analytics-Snapshot-2026-02-24.md`
- Klaviyo-specific: `Projects/Analytics/Klaviyo-Analytics-Snapshot-2026-02-24.md`

## GunStreamer — Major Status Update
- **Platform is now LIVE** — not pre-launch. BRAIN.md and knowledge-graph.md updated.
- Homepage is a blank app embed ("No live or upcoming streams right now"). All marketing lives at /dealercontact.
- /dealercontact: full FFL landing page with all branding, copy, pricing, compliance.
- /forbuyers: full buyer landing page.
- Branding: deep navy (#0a0e1a), red/coral (#e84444), circular crosshair logo, Oswald + DM Sans fonts.

### Deliverables built today
1. `Projects/GunStreamer/Homepage-Redesign-Brief-2026-02-24.md` — full 9-section homepage architecture
2. `Projects/GunStreamer/homepage-prototype.html` — working HTML prototype, open in browser, has demo toggle for LIVE/OFFLINE widget states
3. `Projects/GunStreamer/Dev-Handoff-Live-Widget.md` — API specs (3 endpoints), React component, Next.js SSR option, embed options, design tokens
4. `Projects/GunStreamer/Social-Media-Strategy-2026-02-24.md` — 5 content pillars, platform breakdown, repurposing system, 2-week launch calendar

### Key design decision
Live stream widget is a **feature within the hero**, not the whole page. Two states: LIVE (embed + viewer count + lot card + Bid Now) and OFFLINE (next show + countdown + replay). Conditionally rendered based on `/api/streams/active` API call with 60s polling or Next.js 30s revalidation.

## AGENTS.md Updated
Added `Marketing Skills Dispatch` section with signal→skill mapping table. Now auto-selects appropriate Corey Haines skill (from ~/clawd/skills/) when Troy raises any marketing topic. 30+ skills mapped to triggers.

## Slack Configuration — In Progress
- Bot token staged in config: `xoxb-8973068882337-...`
- User token staged: `xoxp-8973068882337-...`
- **BLOCKED on: App Token (`xapp-...`)** — needed for Socket Mode. Troy needs to get from Slack app settings → Socket Mode → App-Level Tokens.
- Config file updated at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` with Slack entry (appToken placeholder = `__NEEDS_XAPP_TOKEN__`)
- Once xapp token provided: slot in + restart gateway = live on Slack

---

## Blockers (new/updated)
| Item | Project | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Slack xapp token | Infra | Troy needs to get from api.slack.com/apps |
| GA4 access | BBGV | Troy offered to get it — needed to diagnose -29% traffic drop |
| GunStreamer 3 API questions | GunStreamer | What can users DO right now? How were 120K sourced? Primary CTA for Email 1? |

## Lessons Learned
- **Klaviyo reporting API vs UI**: The campaign-values-reports API can return inflated/incorrect stats. Always cross-check against the Klaviyo UI when reporting metrics to Troy. Caught because Troy sent a screenshot showing 21% vs my reported 38%.
- **List profile counts**: The `additional-fields[list]=profile_count` API field works but hits rate limits fast at 1 call/list. Need 1-1.2s delays between calls. Rate limit resets in ~30s.
- **List names ≠ actual counts**: GunStreamer wave names ("Wave 7 (10.0K)") did match actual counts (confirmed 10,000), but never assume — always verify.
- **BRAIN.md was stale**: GunStreamer listed as pre-launch when it's live. Keep BRAIN.md updated in real-time.

## Decisions Made Today
- GunStreamer back in OI.io Sprint Cohort 1 (platform is live, credibility issue resolved)
- Homepage architecture: dual-audience (buyers + dealers), live widget in hero, not full-page app embed
- Social strategy anchored on stream content repurposing: 1 stream → 10+ pieces
- Slack > Telegram for team channel (Troy already in Slack with team)
