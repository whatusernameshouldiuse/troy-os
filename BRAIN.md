Last Updated: 2026-02-21

## Active Projects
- GunStreamer Saturday Night Special promo — In Progress
  - Next: publish first wave posts and monitor join CTR before live
- GTM/CMO Audit System — In Progress
  - Next: fill first-pass scorecard and generate top-10 bottleneck tasks
- BBGV email/lifecycle system — In Progress
  - Next: launch Week 1 flows + hand off website triggers to dev

## Immediate Actions
- Publish GunStreamer first 3 posts + track click/join performance
- Send BBGV trigger handoff doc to dev and start implementation
- Draft/send BBGV Email A (valuation complete route) + Email B (abandonment recovery)

## Background Tasks
- Vault and workspace normalization completed
- Ops hardening docs installed and wired into doctrine
- Heartbeat preflight + material-change behavior active

## Blockers / Attention Needed
- Browser relay Notion attach unreliable; API publisher path remains fallback
- Subagent pairing has intermittently degraded; fallback policy active

## Owner Decisions Needed
- Approve/install flagged third-party skills (case-by-case)
- Rotate exposed Notion token after successful publish
