## Active Projects

### OutdoorInfluencers.io
- **Status:** Phase 0+1 Foundation complete. Outreach + TikTok systems built and ready to fire.
- **Phase 0+1 deliverables done:** Marketing Psychology, Pricing Strategy, 125 Marketing Ideas, Launch Strategy, Free Tool Strategy, Website Copy, Content Strategy, Cold Outreach System (5 files), TikTok System (5 files)
- **Next:** Receive Snov.io creds + sending domain + OI Instagram account → launch outreach engine + start email warm-up
- **Gating:** Boss approval on OI.io concept needed before touching creators

### BBGV — Lead Magnet Engine
- **Status:** Architecture + copy + tech spec complete (3 sub-agent deliverables in Obsidian)
- **Lead magnet:** "What's This Gun Worth Right Now?" — free two-sided valuation tool, email gate, InstaCash offer for sellers
- **Next:** Confirm valuation API endpoint (exists in backend?) + subdomain decision (e.g. value.bluebookofgunvalues.com) → build lead magnet tool
- **Also active:** Email/lifecycle deliverability recovery — triage spam placement root cause in Klaviyo, send to engaged-only segment first

### BBGV — Subscription-Free Transition (ICO + Consignment)
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Next:** Implement website triggers + route users into ICO vs consignment paths → dev handoff

### Rentagun — CRO Audit + Quiz
- **Status:** Audit complete. Quiz build blocked on Troy's answers to 4 questions.
- **4 questions outstanding:**
  1. What broke with RevenueHunt? (Technical / low completion / completed but didn't convert?)
  2. Where does "Get Basic Access" actually lead?
  3. Quiz output: specific gun recommendations OR subscription tier recommendation?
  4. Build platform: WordPress shortcode, Typeform embed, or Next.js on Vercel?

### GunStreamer — NOW LIVE
- **Status:** ✅ Platform is live. Streams are happening. No longer pre-launch.
- **Homepage:** Blank app embed — redesign brief written at `Projects/GunStreamer/Homepage-Redesign-Brief-2026-02-24.md`. Live stream widget + dual audience (buyers/dealers) architecture designed.
- **Email:** ~120K contacts in Klaviyo across 14 lists. Zero emails sent to most. Massive untapped asset.
- **Next:** Develop social media strategy to showcase streams + build hype. 120K email wave. Homepage dev handoff.
- **VSL page:** Needs Troy on camera — /about page concept in redesign brief.
- **OI.io:** Re-add GunStreamer to Sprint Cohort 1 now that platform is live.

### ND Brick Pavers — New Commission Project
- **Status:** Intake. Waiting on assets from Troy.
- **Deal:** Troy earns commission per closed lead referred
- **Migration:** GoHighLevel → Vercel (Next.js + programmatic SEO)
- **Goal:** Lead gen machine — GA4, GSC, FB Pixel, FB ads, social content
- **Blockers:** Need GoHighLevel URL/export, GA4 ID, FB page URL, branding assets, business context for product-marketing-context.md
- **Coordination:** #openclaw-seo in Slack
- **Obsidian:** `Projects/NDBrickPavers/`

### GTM/CMO Audit System
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Next:** Fill first-pass scorecard and produce top-10 bottleneck task list

## Owner Decisions Needed (Blockers)

| Item | Project | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Snov.io client_id + client_secret | OI.io | snov.io/integration/api |
| Cold outreach sending domain | OI.io | Separate from outdoorinfluencers.io |
| OI.io Instagram account | OI.io | For DM sequences |
| Boss approval on OI.io concept | OI.io | Gate before creator outreach |
| BBGV valuation API endpoint | BBGV | Does it exist in backend, or build lookup layer? |
| Subdomain for lead magnet | BBGV | e.g. value.bluebookofgunvalues.com |
| Rentagun quiz 4 questions | Rentagun | See above |
| OI.io pricing decisions | OI.io | J's recommendations pending Troy review |
| OI.io Email 4 proof data | OI.io | Must fix before outreach (FTC risk) |
| J's own accounts (X, GitHub, email) | Infra | Troy to set up |
| Telegram per-project groups | Infra | Troy to decide vs. WhatsApp |

## Immediate Actions

- **GunStreamer Email 1** — blocked on 3 Troy answers: (1) what can users do on gunstreamer.com now? (2) were 120K opted-in or imported? (3) primary CTA — buyer signups, waitlist, or hype?
- **Content Pillar System** — approved for implementation this week across all 5 brands; architecture doc at `Projects/TrafficChannels/content-pillar-architecture.md`
- **ND Brick Pavers intake** — blocked, send assets to #openclaw-seo in Slack
- **BBGV send** — last email Jan 29 (25+ days). List cooling. Send to engaged segment first while deliverability is being diagnosed.
- Deploy `OutdoorInfluencers-LandingPage.html` to outdoorinfluencers.io (ready now)
- Start OI.io email warm-up immediately once sending domain is confirmed (14-day lead time)
- Dev handoff: BBGV website trigger implementation for ICO/consignment routing
- Slack `groupPolicy` → allowlist (security critical — confirm allowed channels with Troy)
