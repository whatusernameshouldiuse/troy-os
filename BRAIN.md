Live operating state. This is the short-term command board.

Last Updated: 2026-02-22

## Active Projects
- BBGV email/lifecycle + deliverability recovery — In Progress
  - Next: triage spam placement root cause in Klaviyo and send to engaged-only segment
- BBGV subscription-free transition (ICO + consignment) — In Progress
  - Next: implement website triggers + route users into ICO vs consignment paths
- GTM/CMO Audit System — In Progress
  - Next: fill first-pass scorecard and produce top-10 bottleneck task list

## Immediate Actions
- Pull Klaviyo campaign metrics (complaint, bounce, unsub, domain performance) and diagnose
- Send BBGV trigger handoff to dev + confirm implementation ETA
- Review incoming subagent deliverables and convert to owner-assigned launch tasks

## Background Tasks
- Vault/workspace normalization completed
- Ops hardening docs installed and wired into doctrine
- Skills registry centralized (`skills-hub/SKILLS-CANONICAL.md` + inventory)
- Active subagents:
  - bbgv-content-machine-v1
  - rentagun-acq-system-v1
  - ops-automation-bottomline

## Blockers / Attention Needed
- Browser relay attach remains unreliable; API publishing path is fallback
- Subagent pairing restored 2026-02-23 08:08 AM (gateway plist repaired + device re-approved)
- Obsidian output integrity gap discovered: some previously claimed `Work/Projects/...` files were not actually written to disk; apply filesystem verification before reporting completion

## Owner Decisions Needed
- Approve/install flagged third-party skills (case-by-case)
- Confirm scope for Gmail/X agent-account ingestion rollout
