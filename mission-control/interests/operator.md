## Current Interests
- Keeping subagent fallback clean when pairing degrades (direct execution as reliable backup)
- Tracking subscription attribution for Rentagun before paid spend scales

## New Curiosities
- What's the right heartbeat gate for verifying overnight subagent/direct-execution outputs? (file count + path check)
- Can we add an automatic preflight probe that detects `pairing required` before delegation attempts fire?

## Signals I'm Watching
- Direct in-session execution produced 9 verified Obsidian files tonight. When subagent pairing is down, this is the reliable path.
- DataForSEO + gateway wrapper is live and loading creds correctly — API layer is ready for content research workflows.
- 7:41 AM preflight: sub-agent spawn check failed twice with `gateway closed (1008): pairing required`; delegation fallback remains required this morning.

## Doctrine Focus
- Filesystem verification before completion reports. Always.
- Rentagun subscription tracking decision is blocking paid acquisition scaling — flag until resolved.
