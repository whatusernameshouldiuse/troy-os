## Recent Notes
- 2026-02-23: 7:41 AM preflight detected active delegation degradation (`gateway closed (1008): pairing required` on spawn test retry); fallback policy remains in force until pairing restores.
- 2026-02-23: Overnight build complete — 9 verified Obsidian files written (4 Rentagun ICP landing pages, 5-email drip, 40-hook ad library, subscription framing, Rentagun README, BBGV 30-day roadmap). Subagent pairing was down; direct execution was the reliable fallback. ICP-anchored copy discipline applied throughout.
- 2026-02-22: 8:41 PM heartbeat surfaced a material reliability gap—claimed Obsidian outputs were not on disk, so completion updates now need filesystem verification before reporting done.
- 2026-02-22: 5:55 PM heartbeat marks a leverage shift—three revenue-focused subagents are now active while the main loop stays focused on high-value orchestration decisions.
- 2026-02-21: 9:08 AM heartbeat confirms material execution progress—Notion API publish path is proven; priority now shifts to live promo distribution and conversion tracking.
- 2026-02-20: 5:19 PM heartbeat confirms a material conversion insight—BBGV email effectiveness depends on deep-link routing into ICO/consignment pages and true valuation-resume recovery links.
- 2026-02-20: 4:49 PM heartbeat locks monetization direction—BBGV transition now anchors on replacing ~$60k subscription revenue via ICO/API speed path + consignment economics floor.
- 2026-02-20: 3:49 PM heartbeat records a material GTM execution jump—BBGV customer-journey flows, trigger handoff specs, and rollout tasks are now structured for immediate implementation.
- 2026-02-20: 2:57 PM heartbeat confirms stronger execution posture—preflight + fallback + API handoff docs reduced fragility in delegation and publishing workflows.
- 2026-02-20: 11:16 AM heartbeat confirms a material operations gain—canonical vault structure plus doctrine-aligned standards improved execution clarity and reduced tool friction.
- 2026-02-20: Established `OPENCLAW-OPERATING-DOCTRINE.md` and added doctrine-focus sections across all core agent interest files.
- 2026-02-20: 7:03 AM heartbeat highlights a practical operating edge—explicit no-go distractions plus freshness-based health signals improve early-day execution control.
- 2026-02-20: 6:33 AM heartbeat reinforces a durable pattern—time-boxed first commits plus stale-run visibility tighten both focus and operational confidence.
- 2026-02-20: 6:03 AM heartbeat indicates strongest morning control comes from explicit owner+checkpoint visibility and objective-fit intake gates.
- 2026-02-20: 5:33 AM heartbeat reinforces a practical filter—priority stability improves when new work must displace an explicitly named task.
- 2026-02-20: 5:03 AM heartbeat suggests a stronger morning control pattern—one next commit plus one visible blocker per objective improves execution clarity.
- 2026-02-20: 4:03 AM heartbeat highlights a stable edge—morning execution accelerates when each objective starts with one owner-tagged first action plus a visible health timestamp.
- 2026-02-19: Mission-control-first operating rhythm is working; focus is now BBGV reactivation system then RentAGun acquisition deployment.
- 2026-02-19: Setup phase is ending—credentials and automations are live, so next leverage comes from fast execution loops and KPI feedback.
- 2026-02-19: Interest updates show a shift from setup work to execution loops, with messaging quality now the primary growth lever.
- 2026-02-19: Interest updates now center on one-ship-target discipline; this should improve daily execution clarity.
- 2026-02-19: Heartbeat updates show a consistent pattern—clarity of next action is the strongest predictor of execution speed.
- 2026-02-19: Heartbeat pass reinforced one pattern—clear owner + clear next commit keeps projects moving fastest.
- 2026-02-19: Evening heartbeat confirms best momentum pattern: one clear CTA per project plus one owner per blocker.
- 2026-02-19: Late-day heartbeat indicates the strongest gains come from deterministic runbooks + one KPI gate per objective.
- 2026-02-19: 7:03 PM heartbeat confirms focus discipline works best when each agent tracks one curiosity tied to one active objective.

- 2026-02-19: 7:33 PM heartbeat shows best operational stability when each workflow publishes a last-success signal.

- 2026-02-19: 8:03 PM heartbeat confirms that a single explicit next action per project keeps momentum intact.

- 2026-02-19: 9:03 PM heartbeat indicates best execution comes from protected priorities and visible system health checks.

- 2026-02-19: 9:33 PM heartbeat reinforces a simple rule: one clear next commit per project drives consistent execution.

- 2026-02-19: 10:03 PM heartbeat confirms durable execution pattern—clear owner + concrete next action + visible health signals.

- 2026-02-19: 10:33 PM heartbeat reinforces one pattern: protect priorities with hard intake filters and visible next actions.

- 2026-02-19: 11:03 PM heartbeat confirms the strongest operating pattern: one pinned priority, one next commit, one visible health signal.

- 2026-02-19: 11:33 PM heartbeat confirms cleanest momentum pattern—one clear ask, one owner, one health signal.

- 2026-02-20: 12:03 AM heartbeat shows strongest momentum when daily work begins with one concrete owned action per project.

- 2026-02-20: 12:33 AM heartbeat confirms fastest start comes from a dashboard that surfaces owner, blocker, and immediate next commit.

- 2026-02-20: 1:03 AM heartbeat reinforces deterministic execution: one first task, one intake gate, one health signal.

- 2026-02-20: 1:33 AM heartbeat keeps reinforcing the same edge: one clear next commit plus visible automation health.

- 2026-02-20: 2:03 AM heartbeat again validates deterministic execution: hard intake gate + visible next commit + health signal.

- 2026-02-20: 2:33 AM heartbeat confirms best pace comes from objective-linked intake and one first deliverable per project.

- 2026-02-20: 3:03 AM heartbeat continues to validate one pattern—strict intake gates plus visible first deliverables protect execution quality.

- 2026-02-20: 3:33 AM heartbeat keeps confirming the same edge: strict intake + visible first action + daily health signal.
