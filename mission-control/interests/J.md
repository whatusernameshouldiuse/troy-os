# INTERESTS.md — J

## Current Interests
- Shipping content machines that produce without Troy needing to manage them
- Building acquisition funnels that are ICP-anchored, not generic

## New Curiosities
- Which Rentagun ICP converts at the lowest CAC on paid? Considerer vs New Owner are the highest-volume hypotheses.
- What's the fastest path from BBGV blog → ICO start? Email teaser or direct social → LP?
- Which TikTok hook family compounds fastest for OI.io creator recruitment: identity pain ("not an influencer") vs payout proof ("first $500")?

## Signals I'm Watching
- Overnight direct execution (no subagents) produced 9 verified files. Reliability > speed when pairing is degraded.
- ICP-first filtering is the highest-leverage copy discipline — every asset improves when the persona is explicit before writing.
- Two TikTok systems shipped in parallel (brands + OI.io) with reusable hook banks and experiment logs — content ops now has a testable loop instead of ad-hoc posting.

## Doctrine Focus
- Verify files exist on disk before reporting done. No phantom completions.
- Content machines only work if Troy's input friction is minimal — screenshot + data, nothing more.
