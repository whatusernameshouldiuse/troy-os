# Autonomy Ladder

Defines what can run automatically vs what requires Troy approval.

## Level 1 — Auto (No approval needed)
- Internal research
- Drafting docs/copy/options
- File organization + non-destructive cleanup
- Routine status checks / preflight checks
- Creating task backlogs and plans

## Level 2 — Auto with notification
- Scheduling non-critical internal workflows
- Updating operating docs, SOPs, and templates
- Running low-risk automations with clear rollback

## Level 3 — Approval required
- External publishing (posts/emails/public content)
- Customer-facing sends or pricing changes
- New credentials/integrations with broad access
- Destructive file actions or irreversible changes

## Level 4 — Explicit consent every time
- Financial actions
- Security policy changes
- Anything affecting legal/compliance exposure

## Escalation Rule
If uncertain: pause, present 2 options + recommendation, ask once.
