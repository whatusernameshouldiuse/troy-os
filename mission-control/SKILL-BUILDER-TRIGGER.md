# Skill Builder Trigger Rules

Create/update a reusable SOP/skill when any condition is true:
- Same task repeated 2+ times in 7 days
- Same failure/debug cycle repeated
- Multi-step process with handoff risk
- High-value workflow likely to recur

## Output each time
- SOP draft (`SOP-<workflow>.md`)
- Input/Output checklist
- Failure modes + recovery steps
- Candidate skill scope
